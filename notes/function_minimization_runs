run1:
10 iterations. Change whole code.
Finds best solution after 1 iteration. Goes from program that gives static output to random output - and somehow works

run2:
20 iterations. Change whole code.
The best solution is still the random output, but now the programs try to import scipy, which fails because that library is not installed.
In next run I'll try to install the library

run3:
Same as previous run, but now lib deap is missing.

run4:
100 iterations. Change whole code. With all necessary libraries
The best program gets nearly perfect score! It uses differentials to evaluate best function value.
However it changes the whole code...

run5:
10 iterations on 70b model.

run6:
same as run 4 but done on 70b model. Gets best solution after 3 iterations.

run8:
10 iterations - tested new SEARCH/REPLACE that ignores trailing spaces. Indentations are still a problem

run9:
10 iterations - tested new SEARCH/REPLACE with smart indenations. Looks like it works.
