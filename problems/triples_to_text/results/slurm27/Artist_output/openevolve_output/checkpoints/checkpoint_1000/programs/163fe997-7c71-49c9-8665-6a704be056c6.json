You will be given the current Python program with its BLUE score and an inspiration program and your task will be to evolve the current Python program to improve the score. It is a program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program must implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

One approach is to create more complex sentences by combining related triples. Here's a suggested improvement:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Combine sentences for subjects that are related (e.g., through associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist)\n    related_sentences = {}\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        subject = sentence.split(' ')[0]\n        related_sentences[subject] = sentence\n\n    for triple in triples:\n        if triple.predicate == \"associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist\":\n            band = triple.object\n            for sentence in sentences:\n                if band in sentence:\n                    subject = triple.subject\n                    if subject in related_sentences and sentence != related_sentences[subject]:\n                        related_sentences[subject] = related_sentences[subject] + \", and \" + sentence.split(', and')[1]\n\n    # Return the combined sentences\n    return '. '.join(related_sentences.values()) + '.'\n=======\n    # Create a dictionary to store the sentences for each subject\n    subject_sentences = {}\n    for triple in triples:\n        subject = triple.subject\n        if subject not in subject_sentences:\n            subject_sentences[subject] = []\n        # Create a sentence for the current triple\n        if triple.predicate == \"genre\":\n            sentence = f\"{triple.subject} plays {triple.object} music\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"instrument\":\n            sentence = f\"{triple.subject} plays the {triple.object}\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"occupation\":\n            sentence = f\"{triple.subject} is a {triple.object}\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"background\":\n            sentence = f\"{triple.subject} has a background as {triple.object}\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"birthPlace\":\n            sentence = f\"{triple.subject} was born in {triple.object}\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist\":\n            sentence = f\"{triple.subject} is associated with the band {triple.object}\"\n        else:\n            sentence = f\"{triple.subject} has a {triple.predicate} of {triple.object}\"\n        subject_sentences[subject].append(sentence)\n\n    # Combine the sentences for each subject\n    combined_sentences = []\n    for subject, sentences in subject_sentences.items():\n        combined_sentence = sentences[0]\n        for sentence in sentences[1:]:\n            combined_sentence += f\", and {sentence}\"\n        combined_sentences.append(combined_sentence)\n\n    # Combine the sentences for related subjects\n    related_sentences = {}\n    for triple in triples:\n        if triple.predicate == \"associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist\":\n            band = triple.object\n            for sentence in combined_sentences:\n                if band in sentence:\n                    subject = triple.subject\n                    if subject in related_sentences and sentence != related_sentences[subject]:\n                        related_sentences[subject] = related_sentences[subject] + f\", and is also associated with {sentence.split('associated with the band')[1]}\"\n    for subject, sentence in related_sentences.items():\n        combined_sentences[combined_sentences.index(related_sentences[subject].split(', and is also associated with')[0])] = sentence\n\n    # Return the combined sentences\n    return '. '.join(combined_sentences) + '.'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis improved code creates more complex sentences by combining related triples and uses a more sophisticated approach to combine the sentences for each subject. It also handles the \"associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist\" predicate more effectively by combining the sentences for related subjects."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"LOW BLUE SCORE 0\": \"The program did very poorly with the given triples, getting BLEU score 0.0.
