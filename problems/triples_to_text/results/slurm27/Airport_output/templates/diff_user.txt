# Task
Suggest an improvement to the current program that will improve the BLUE Score.
Different solutions with similar BLUE score but different ideas are valuable.
Creating one complex sentence from all the given triples will award greater score as well.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly, indentations and endlines as well)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of a valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    best_x = 0
    best_y = 0
=======
    # Initialize with a random point
    best_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])
    best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])
>>>>>>> REPLACE

The SEARCH section must exactly match the code in the current program, even with it's indentations and endlines.
Give just one SEARCH/REPLACE section.
