Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

for each leader found. This leads to awkward phrasing like \"\u2026and its leader is X and its leader is Y.\" The suggested change checks if the word \"leader\" already exists in the sentence. If it does, it appends \"and another leader is\" instead, resulting in a more natural sentence structure: \"\u2026and its leader is X and another leader is Y.\" This small adjustment can significantly improve readability and potentially the BLEU score by aligning more closely with the reference sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_694\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
