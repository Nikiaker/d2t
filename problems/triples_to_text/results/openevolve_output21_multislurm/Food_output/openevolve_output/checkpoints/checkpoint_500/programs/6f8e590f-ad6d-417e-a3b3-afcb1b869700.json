Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe primary goal is to make the generated sentences flow more naturally. The changes aim to achieve this by:\n\n1.  **Simplifying phrasing:** Replacing \"which is a variation of\" with \"a variation of\" and \"and is home to\" with \"home to\" makes the sentence less verbose.\n2.  **Improving conditional logic:** The `if predicate in (...)` block was nested within the `else` block, which made the logic less readable. By moving it to an outer `if`, the code becomes clearer and more directly expresses the intent to handle specific predicates differently. This also avoids unnecessary `sentence = sentence.replace(...)` calls.\n3.  **More consistent structure:**  The structure for handling `country`, `language`, and `leader` is now more consistent and directly appends the phrase \"where the predicate is object\\_val\" instead of attempting a replace operation. This is more efficient and easier to understand.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_564\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
