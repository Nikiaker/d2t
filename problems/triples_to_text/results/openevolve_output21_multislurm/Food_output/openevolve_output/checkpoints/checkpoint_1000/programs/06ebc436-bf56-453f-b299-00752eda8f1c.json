Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food.

Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

sentences that are often disjointed and lack flow, particularly when dealing with multiple triples. It simply concatenates clauses based on the predicate. To improve coherence, let's introduce a more sophisticated approach to handling multiple predicates related to the same subject. Specifically, let's combine related predicates (e.g., ingredient and mainIngredient) into a single clause using \"and\" or \"as well as\".\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if
