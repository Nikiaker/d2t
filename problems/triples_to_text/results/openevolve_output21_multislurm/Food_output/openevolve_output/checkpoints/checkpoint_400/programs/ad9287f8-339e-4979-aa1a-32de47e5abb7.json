Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code often resulted in run-on sentences because it didn't consistently end clauses with a period. Adding a period at the end of each clause within the `else` block (especially for predicates like `course`, `dishVariation`, etc.) will improve sentence structure and readability, which should lead to a higher BLEU score. This ensures each fact is more clearly delineated within the generated text. This change also applies to the cases where the predicates have the same structure."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_58\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
