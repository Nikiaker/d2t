Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

Conjunctions:** Using \"and\" more consistently instead of starting new clauses with \"which\" makes the sentence more readable.\n*   **Refined verb choices:** Changing \"is made with\" to \"containing\" and similar changes to create a more concise and natural tone.\n*   **Consistency:** Using \"and\" as a standard connector for multiple attributes.\n*   **Better handling of people/inhabitants:** Changed \"and is associated with\" to \"and is inhabited by\" for ethnic groups, making the sentence more logically sound.\n*   **Removed redundancy:** Removed unnecessary repetition of \"is\".\n\nThese changes aim to generate sentences that are grammatically more correct and read more naturally, which should improve the BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json":
