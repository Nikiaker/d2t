"You are an expert data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: University. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

sentences, especially when multiple triples are processed. The phrase \"and has a...\" can become repetitive and doesn't always flow naturally.\n\nThe proposed change aims to improve this by:\n\n1.  **Using \"and also has a\"**:  Replacing \"and has a\" with \"and also has a\" adds a slight emphasis and can make the sentence structure less monotonous.\n2.  **Combining City and Country**: If the first triple defines the subject as a city, the second triple defining the country should be linked with \"and is located in\" to create a more natural flow.\n3.  **`.strip()`**: Adding `.strip()` to the return statement removes any potential leading or trailing whitespace, resulting in cleaner output.\n\nThese small adjustments can help the program generate more fluent and readable sentences, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score by better matching the phrasing of the reference sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
