Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: University. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

structure. The proposed change groups all clauses into a list (`clauses`) and then joins them with spaces.  This helps in forming a more readable and grammatically correct sentence, especially when dealing with multiple triples.  The `current_subject` variable is initialized and used to ensure the subject is only mentioned at the beginning. This will hopefully lead to a higher BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_1\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
