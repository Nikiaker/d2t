Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: University. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

REPLACE\n```\n\nKey changes and reasoning:\n\n*   **More fluid sentence structure:** Instead of always starting with the subject for each triple, the code now builds upon the initial subject and uses relative clauses (\"which is in...\", \", which is located in...\") to connect subsequent information.\n*   **Combined initial conditions**: Combined the initial if statements to build the first sentence using the subject.\n*   **Focus on cohesion:** The use of \"which\" and \"and\" creates a more natural flow and avoids repetitive sentence structures.  This helps the generated text sound less like a list of facts and more like a coherent description.\n*   **Simplified Logic**: Reduced redundant code by combining similar conditional statements"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_1\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
