the list of triples instead of just using the first one.\n*   **Conditional Sentence Building:**  It uses a series of `if/elif/else` statements to construct the sentence based on the predicate.  This allows for different sentence structures depending on the relationship between the subject and object.\n*   **Handling Various Predicates:** The code now includes conditional logic for all the specified predicates.\n*   **Contextual Phrases:** Added contextual phrases like \"is a city in,\" \"which is in,\" \"also known as,\" etc. to create a more natural flow.\n*   **Subject Tracking:** The code stores the subject of the first triple to use it in subsequent clauses, creating more complex sentences.\n*   **Default Case:** Includes a default case for handling any unknown predicates.\n\nThis approach significantly improves the program's ability to handle multiple triples and generate more coherent and contextually relevant sentences, which should result in a higher BLEU score.  The conditional logic is expanded to cover all the defined predicates, and the sentence structure is more flexible."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
