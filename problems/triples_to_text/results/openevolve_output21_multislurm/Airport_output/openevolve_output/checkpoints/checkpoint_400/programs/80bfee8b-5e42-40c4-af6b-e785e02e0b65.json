Replacing \", which is part of\" with \" and is part of\" creates a smoother flow.  Similarly, changing \", and is\" to \", with an elevation of\" for elevation-related predicates makes the sentence more natural.  The change from \", {predicate} is {object}\" to \" and {predicate} is {object}\" provides better sentence structure. These small adjustments aim to improve the coherence and readability of the generated sentences, which should translate to a higher BLEU score by more closely matching the reference sentences.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is part of {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", which is part of {triple.object}.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", and is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", and is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n            else:\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}.\"\n        first_triple = False\n=======\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is part of {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and is part of {triple.object}.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", with an elevation of {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", with an elevation of {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n            else:\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}.\"\n        first_triple = False\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_57\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
