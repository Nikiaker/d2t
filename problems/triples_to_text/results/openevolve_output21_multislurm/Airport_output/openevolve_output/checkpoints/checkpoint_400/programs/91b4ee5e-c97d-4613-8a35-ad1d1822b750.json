Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

Specifically, it checks if the current `triple.predicate` is one of  \"isPartOf\", \"location\", or \"country\". If it is, it appends the information using \"which is\" to create a more natural flow and embed the information within the existing sentence rather than simply appending it with \"and\". This aims to improve sentence coherence when dealing with multiple descriptive triples, leading to a higher BLUE score.  The other predicates still use the \"and\" connector as before. This is a targeted improvement to address the need for better sentence structure when handling relational information.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_139\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
