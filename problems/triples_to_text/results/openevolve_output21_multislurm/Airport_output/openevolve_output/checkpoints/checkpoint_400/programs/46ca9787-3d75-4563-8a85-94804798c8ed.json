Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

Replacing \"which is located in\" with \"and is located in\" for `country` improves flow. \"Which\" often introduces a non-restrictive clause, which isn't the intention here.\n*   **\"the capital of which is\" to \"where the capital is\"**:  Similar to the above, replacing \"the capital of which is\" with \"where the capital is\" for `capital` makes the sentence more natural.\n*   **\"and is located\" to \"and is at an elevation of\"**: Replacing \"and is located\" with \"and is at an elevation of\" for `elevationAboveTheSeaLevel` for better readability.\n*   **Removed redundant \"which is\"**: Removed \"which is\" for `operatingOrganisation` for more concise language.\n\nThese changes aim to produce more fluent and grammatically correct sentences, which should lead to a higher BLEU
