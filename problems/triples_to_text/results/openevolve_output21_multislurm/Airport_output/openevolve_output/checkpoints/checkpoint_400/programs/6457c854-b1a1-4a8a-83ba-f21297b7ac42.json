Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

+= f\"{triple.subject} is the capital of {triple.object}.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"country\" and sentence.endswith(f\"{triple.subject} is in {triple.object}.\"):\n

capital of {triple.object}.\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code had a specific conditional check (`triple.predicate == \"country\" and sentence.endswith(...)`) to try and create a more concise sentence when 'capital' followed 'country'. However, this was overly restrictive and could easily be missed if the order of triples changed or if other predicates were present.\n\nThe proposed change simplifies this logic.  Instead of checking for a specific sentence ending, it always appends \", which is the capital of {triple.object}.\" when 'capital' is encountered after the first triple. This creates a more consistent and natural-sounding sentence structure, improving readability and potentially the BLEU score by aligning more closely with the example sentences. It makes the code cleaner and more robust to variations in input triple order.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_140\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
