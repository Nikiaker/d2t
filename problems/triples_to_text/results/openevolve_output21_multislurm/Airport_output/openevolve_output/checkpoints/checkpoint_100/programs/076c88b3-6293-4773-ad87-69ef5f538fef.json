Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code used \"has a {predicate} of {object}\" repeatedly, which sounds robotic and repetitive.  The change replaces this with more natural phrasing like \"{predicate} is {object}\" and adds \"Additionally\" for subsequent triples to improve sentence flow. This addresses the issue of generating grammatically awkward sentences, particularly when dealing with multiple triples. The use of \"Additionally\" acts as a conjunction to connect multiple pieces of information more smoothly. This change aims to increase the BLEU score by generating sentences closer to those in the example correct sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_295\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
