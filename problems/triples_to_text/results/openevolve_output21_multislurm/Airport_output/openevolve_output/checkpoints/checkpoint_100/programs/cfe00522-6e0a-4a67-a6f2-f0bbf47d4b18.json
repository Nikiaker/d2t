code now iterates through the list of triples.\n*   **Conditional Sentence Building:**  It uses `if/elif` statements to handle different predicates and append appropriate phrases to the `sentence` string.  This allows for building a more complex sentence based on the available information.\n*   **Handles Multiple Predicates:** The loop allows it to process any number of triples.\n*   **Basic Contextualization:**  The code attempts to add some basic context (e.g., \"It is located in...\") to improve coherence.\n*   **`.strip()`:** Removes leading/trailing whitespace from the final sentence.\n*   **Docstring:** Added a docstring for better readability and understanding.\n*   **Predicate Coverage:** Includes handling for all predicates listed in the prompt.\n\nThis improved version should significantly increase the BLUE score by generating more informative and grammatically correct sentences that reflect the relationships between the entities in the triples.  The conditional logic provides a foundation for more sophisticated sentence generation in the future.  It\u2019s still relatively simple but a large step up from just returning the first triple\u2019s information.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"error_type\": \"AllTrialsFailed\", \"error_message\": \"All trials failed - common issues: timeouts, crashes, or invalid return values\", \"suggestion\": \"Check for infinite loops, ensure function returns a str\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
