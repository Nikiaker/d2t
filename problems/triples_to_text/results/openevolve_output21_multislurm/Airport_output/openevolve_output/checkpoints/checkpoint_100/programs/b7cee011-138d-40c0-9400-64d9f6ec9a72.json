Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

the program's ability to create more complex and coherent sentences, particularly when multiple triples are provided. The current implementation simply concatenates sentences generated from each triple. We can improve this by attempting to combine information where possible, especially when dealing with relationships like location and country.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    sentence = \"\"\n\n    for triple in triples:\n        if triple.predicate == \"cityServed\":\n            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} serves the city of {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"country\":\n            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is in {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"capital\":\n            sentence += f\"The capital of {triple.subject} is {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevel\":\n            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} has an elevation of {triple.object} meters above sea level. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"location\":\n            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is located in {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"operatingOrganisation\":\n            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is operated by {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"runwayLength\":\n            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} has a runway length of {triple.object} meters. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"runwayName\":\n            sentence += f\"The runway at {triple.subject} is named {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"1stRunwayLengthFeet\":\n            sentence += f\"The first runway at {triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet long. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"1stRunwaySurfaceType\":\n            sentence += f\"The first runway at {triple.subject} has a surface of {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"icaoLocationIdentifier\":\n            sentence += f\"The ICAO location identifier for {triple.subject} is {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"iataLocationIdentifier\":\n            sentence += f\"The IATA location identifier for {triple.subject} is {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"nativeName\":\n            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is also known as {triple.object}. \"\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is part of {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet\":\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet above sea level. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres\":\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} metres above sea level. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"leader\":\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is led by {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"mayor\":\n                sentence += f\"The mayor of {triple.subject} is {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"owner\":\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is owned by {triple.object}. \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} -

Then, subsequent predicates are handled with context. For example, if a \"capital\" triple is encountered *after* a \"country\" triple, the sentence is constructed as \"The capital of [country] is [capital]\". Similarly, for \"operatingOrganisation\", if a location has been identified, it is included in the sentence (\"...located in [location] is operated by...\"). This aims to create more complex and natural-sounding sentences by linking related information from multiple triples."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"error_type\": \"AllTrialsFailed\", \"error_message\": \"All trials failed - common issues: timeouts, crashes, or invalid return values\", \"suggestion\": \"Check for infinite loops, ensure function returns a str\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
