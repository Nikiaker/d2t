Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

processed.\n*   **Conditional Sentence Structure:**  The code now uses `if first_triple:` to determine how to start the sentence versus how to append information from subsequent triples. This allows for more natural sentence flow with connecting words like \"which\", \"where\", \"and\", and commas.\n*   **Improved Connecting Phrases:** Replaced generic \"and\" with more contextually appropriate phrases for better readability and coherence.\n*   **Removed redundant `else` block**: The original `else` block was identical for all cases, making it unnecessary.\n\nThis change aims to generate more complex and grammatically correct sentences by intelligently connecting information from multiple triples, which should significantly improve the BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_194\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
