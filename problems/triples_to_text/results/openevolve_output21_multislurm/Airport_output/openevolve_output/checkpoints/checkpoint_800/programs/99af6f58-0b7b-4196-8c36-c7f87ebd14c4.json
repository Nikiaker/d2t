The change aims to make the sentence flow more naturally. Specifically, switching the order of subject and object in the \"capital\" predicate case (\"{triple.object} is the capital of {triple.subject}.\") improves readability.  Also, simplifying \"situated in\" to \"in\" for the \"country\" predicate improves conciseness. This subtle change can contribute to a higher BLEU score by creating sentences that more closely resemble the reference sentences in terms of phrasing and structure.  The current implementation prioritizes adding more information rather than creating a natural flow.
