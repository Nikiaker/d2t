Instead of using \"and is in\" or \", where the capital is\", the revised code uses \"which is in\" and \", the capital of which is\".  This creates a more concise and grammatically sophisticated sentence structure, particularly when chaining multiple facts together. Using relative clauses (\"which is\", \"of which\") helps to create a smoother flow and avoids the slightly awkward repetition of independent clauses connected by \"and\".  This should lead to improved BLEU scores, as the generated sentences will be closer to the reference sentences in terms of phrasing and style.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        elif triple.predicate == \"country\":\n            if first_triple:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is located in {triple.object}.\"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\" and is in {triple.object}.\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"capital\":\n            if first_triple:\n                sentence += f\"The capital of {triple.subject} is {triple.object}.\"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\", where the capital is {triple.object}.\"\n=======\n        elif triple.predicate == \"country\":\n            if first_triple:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is located in {triple.object}.\"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\", which is in {triple.object}.\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"capital\":\n            if first_triple:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is the capital of {triple.object}.\"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\", the capital of which is {triple.object}.\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_39\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
