Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This leads to more natural and fluent sentence construction when combining information about a country with its capital, demonym, and leader.  This change aims to create sentences that more closely resemble how a human would express the same information, potentially improving the BLEU score by aligning more closely with reference sentences.
