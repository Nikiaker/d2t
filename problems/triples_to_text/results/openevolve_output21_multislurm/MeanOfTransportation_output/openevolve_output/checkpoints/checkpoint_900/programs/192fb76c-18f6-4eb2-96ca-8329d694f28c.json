data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

\"where people are known as {demonym\\_info.object}\" to \"and its people are called {demonym\\_info.object}\". This makes the phrasing more natural and avoids awkward constructions.\n*   **More fluid sentence structure:**  Replaced the `\"{subject} is a country {', '.join(country_details)}. \"` structure with `\"{subject} is located in {country}, \" + \", \".join(country_details) + \". \"`. This change ensures that the sentence flows better, particularly when multiple details about the country are present. This addresses a common issue of the previous version sounding stilted.\n*   **Contextual connection:** By rephrasing, the sentence more directly connects the subject to the country and its attributes, rather than stating it *is* a country with certain attributes. This is a subtle but important change for natural language generation.\n\nThis modification aims to produce more coherent and grammatically correct sentences when dealing with triples involving countries and their associated properties.
