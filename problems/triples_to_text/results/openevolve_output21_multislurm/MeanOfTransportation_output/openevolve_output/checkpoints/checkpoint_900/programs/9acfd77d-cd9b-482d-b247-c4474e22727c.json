Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

Previously, the code constructed a sentence like \"{subject}, which is in {country}, with {capital} as its capital...\". This phrasing is a bit awkward.  The revised code creates a more natural flow by saying \"{subject} is in {country}, whose capital is {capital}...\". This change is subtle, but it can contribute to better sentence structure and fluency, which is what BLEU score measures. Also I've added \"and\" to the productionStartYear predicate, making the sentence more natural.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_137\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
