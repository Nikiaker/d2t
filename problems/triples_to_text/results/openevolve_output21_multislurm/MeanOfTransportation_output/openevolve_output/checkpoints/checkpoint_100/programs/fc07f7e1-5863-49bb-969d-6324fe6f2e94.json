Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

repetitive and unnatural sentences.  The proposed change introduces specific handling for predicates like \"relatedMeanOfTransportation\", \"country\", and \"capital\" to create more natural connections between the entities.  For other predicates, it uses \"and its predicate is object_value\" which is a slight improvement over the original. This will allow the program to generate sentences that are more grammatically correct and contextually relevant, resulting in a higher BLEU score.
