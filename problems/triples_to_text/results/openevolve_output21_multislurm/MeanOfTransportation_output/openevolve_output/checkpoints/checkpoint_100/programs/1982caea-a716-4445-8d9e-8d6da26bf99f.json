Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This limits the ability to create more complex sentences when other predicates appear later in the triple list. The suggested change adds handling for the \"capital\" predicate, allowing the program to generate sentences like \"\u2026which is in Belgium, and its capital is Brussels.\"  This directly addresses the example provided in the prompt and will improve the program's ability to generate more coherent and contextually relevant sentences when dealing with location-based information.  The inclusion of \"located in\" instead of just \"in\" sounds more natural.  This change aims to improve the flow and readability of the generated text, leading to a higher BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_314\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
