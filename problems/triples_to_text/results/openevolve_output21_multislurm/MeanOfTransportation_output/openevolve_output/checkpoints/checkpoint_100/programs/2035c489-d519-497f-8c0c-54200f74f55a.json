Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

0` within the `else` block.  More importantly, it lacked a consistent way to refer back to the original subject (`subject`) when adding subsequent triples. By changing `predicate is` to `its predicate is`, we create a more natural flow, indicating that the property belongs to the initial subject. This modification aims to improve sentence readability and coherence, especially when dealing with longer chains of triples. The redundant check for `i == 0` is removed to simplify the logic. This small change should contribute to a higher BLEU score by producing more natural-sounding sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_420\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
