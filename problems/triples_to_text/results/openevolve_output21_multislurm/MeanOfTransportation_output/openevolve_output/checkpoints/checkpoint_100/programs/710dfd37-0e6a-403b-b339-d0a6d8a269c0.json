Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

improvements.", "responses": ["Here's a suggested improvement focusing on creating more complex and natural-sounding sentences by attempting to connect triples based on shared subjects:\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    sentence = sentences[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(sentences)):\n        sentence += \" and \" + sentences[i]\n=======\n    if not sentences:\n        return

\"and\". This often results in disjointed and unnatural phrasing. The suggested change attempts to improve fluency by checking if the subsequent sentence starts with the same subject as the current sentence. If it does, it assumes a relationship and combines the relevant parts of the sentences (removing the redundant subject and the initial comma) with a comma. If the subjects differ, it falls back to the original \"and\" concatenation. This should lead to more coherent and readable sentences, especially when multiple triples relate to the same entity.  This leverages the fact that many triples will share the same subject and creating a more complex sentence structure will increase the BLUE score.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"error_type\": \"AllTrialsFailed\", \"error_message\": \"All trials failed - common issues: timeouts, crashes, or invalid return values\", \"suggestion\": \"Check for infinite loops, ensure function returns a str\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
