Adding \"its\" before the predicate (\"and its {predicate} is...\") creates a more natural flow, implying possession and connection to the main subject. Using \"it also has\" instead of \"also has\" provides better readability. This change aims to improve the sentence structure and make it sound less like a list of facts and more like a cohesive description.
