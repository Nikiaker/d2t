Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

`country` predicate by optionally adding the capital if found.  The improved code expands this to also check for `demonym` (people's name) and `leader` information related to the same country. It then constructs a more descriptive sentence incorporating all available information about the country, making the generated text more informative and coherent.  This approach aims to better utilize the relationships within the triples, resulting in a higher BLEU score as it more closely resembles the reference sentences that often combine multiple facts. I've also preserved the original logic in case not all information is available, falling back to the basic \"located in\" statement.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_132\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
