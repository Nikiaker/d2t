data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

is constructed when the predicate is \"country\".  The original code used \"is in\" and a comma, then a series of appended clauses. This can sound a bit disjointed.\n\nThe modified code uses \"which is in\" to introduce the country and its related information more smoothly. It also slightly adjusts the phrasing of the sentence parts (e.g., \"with ... as its capital\" instead of \"whose capital is...\") to improve flow and sound more natural. The aim is to create a single, more complex sentence instead of a series of shorter, connected clauses.  This should lead to higher BLEU scores by more closely matching the phrasing of the example correct sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_9\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
