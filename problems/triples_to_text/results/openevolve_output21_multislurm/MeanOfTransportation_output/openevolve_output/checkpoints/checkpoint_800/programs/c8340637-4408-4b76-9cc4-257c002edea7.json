Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This loop iterates through the remaining triples. If it finds a triple with the same subject as the current country, and the predicate isn't one already handled (capital, demonym, leader), it appends a new clause to the sentence, incorporating the information from that triple. This attempts to combine related facts about the same entity into a single, more comprehensive sentence.  This avoids repetitive sentence structures like \"Argentina is a country in South America.
