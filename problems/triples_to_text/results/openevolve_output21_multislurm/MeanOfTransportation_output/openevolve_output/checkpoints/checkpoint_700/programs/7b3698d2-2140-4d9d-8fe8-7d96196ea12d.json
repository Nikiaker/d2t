Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code had a slightly awkward phrasing (\"is in\").  The change replaces \"is in\" with \"which is in\" to create a more natural relative clause.  More importantly, the wording of the sentence parts (capital, demonym, leader) is adjusted to be more fluent and contextually appropriate.  \"inhabitants are called\" sounds more natural than \"people are known as\". The addition of the comma before \"which\" further improves readability.  These small changes, when applied consistently across multiple triples, can contribute to a more coherent and higher-scoring output."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_204\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
