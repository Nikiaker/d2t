Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

`sentences[i+1].split(\" \")[0] + \" \" + sentences[i+1].split(\" \")[1]` to extract the first two words from the next sentence when combining based on \"location\" or \"owner\". This is brittle and could lead to incorrect phrasing if the sentence structure isn't as expected. The corrected code replaces this with `sentences[i+1].lstrip()`, which simply takes the entire next sentence after removing leading whitespace.  This approach is more robust and allows the sentence to flow more naturally without forcing a specific word count, increasing the likelihood of generating a grammatically correct and semantically similar sentence to the reference, which should improve the BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_173\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
