This improvement replaces that with a more general approach to create relative clauses (using \"which\") when relevant properties are present.  It iterates through the properties and explicitly checks for combinations like \"discoverer\" and \"epoch,\" \"birthDate\" and \"deathDate,\" or \"formerName\" and \"epoch\" to construct more fluent and informative sentences.  The previous code's reliance on a hardcoded list of subjects is removed, making it more adaptable. By prioritizing relative clauses, the generated sentences are more likely to capture relationships between different attributes of the same entity, resulting in a higher BLEU score. The code is simplified and more readable.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if len(properties) > 1:\n            if subject in [\"Walter Baade\", \"James Craig Watson\", \"Grigory Neujmin\"]:\n                sentence = f\"{subject}, who {', '.join(properties[:-1])} and {properties[-1]}.\"\n            elif \"discovered\" in [p for p in properties]:\n                discoverer = next((obj for pred, obj in data if pred == \"discoverer\"), None)\n                if discoverer:\n                    sentence = f\"{discoverer} discovered {subject}, which {', '.join([p for p in properties if p != f'was discovered by {discoverer}'])}.\"\n                elif \"birthDate\" in [p for p in properties] and \"deathDate\" in [p for p in properties]:\n                    birth_date = next((obj for pred, obj in data if pred == \"birthDate\"), None)\n                    death_date = next((obj for pred, obj in data if pred == \"deathDate\"), None)\n                    sentence = f\"{subject} was born on {birth_date} and died on {death_date}, and {', '.join([p for p in properties if p not in [f'was born on {birth_date}', f'died on {death_date}']])}.\"\n\n                else:\n                    sentence = f\"{subject} {', '.join(properties[:-1]) + ' and ' + properties[-1]}.\"\n            else:\n                sentence = f\"{subject} {', '.join(properties[:-1]) + ' and ' + properties[-1]}.\"\n        else:\n            sentence = f\"{subject} {properties[0]}.\"\n=======\n        if len(properties) > 1:\n            sentence_parts = []\n            for prop in properties:\n                sentence_parts.append(prop)\n\n            # Prioritize creating relative clauses for better flow\n            if \"discoverer\" in sentence_parts and \"epoch\" in sentence_parts:\n                discoverer_prop = next((p for p in sentence_parts if \"discoverer\" in p), None)\n                epoch_prop = next((p for p in sentence_parts if \"epoch\" in p), None)\n                sentence = f\"{subject} was discovered by {discoverer_prop.split('was discovered by ')[1]}, which has an epoch of {epoch_prop.split('has an epoch of ')[1]}.\"\n            elif \"birthDate\" in sentence_parts and \"deathDate\" in sentence_parts:\n                birth_date_prop = next((p for p in sentence_parts if \"birthDate\" in p), None)\n                death_date_prop = next((p for p in sentence_parts if \"deathDate\" in p), None)\n                sentence = f\"{subject} was born on {birth_date_prop.split('was born on ')[1]} and died on {death_date_prop.split('died on ')[1]}.\"\n            elif \"formerName\" in sentence_parts and \"epoch\" in sentence_parts:\n                former_name_prop = next((p for p in sentence_parts if \"formerName\" in p), None)\n                epoch_prop = next((p for p in sentence_parts if \"epoch\" in p), None)\n                sentence = f\"{subject}, formerly known as {former_name_prop.split('was formerly known as ')[1]}, has an epoch of {epoch_prop.split('has an epoch of ')[1]}.\"\n            else:\n                sentence = f\"{subject} {', '.join(sentence_parts[:-1]) + ' and ' + sentence_parts[-1]}.\"\n        else:\n            sentence = f\"{subject} {properties[0]}.\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
