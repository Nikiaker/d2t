data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

Change:**\n\nThe key improvement is within the `country` predicate handling.  The original code only checked for the existence of a \"capital\" triple. The updated code *also* checks for a \"language\" triple.  If both a capital and language are found associated with the country, it combines these facts into a single, more informative sentence:  `\"{subject} is in {object_}, which has {capital} as its capital and {language} as its official language.\"`\n\nThis change aims to create more complex sentences by relating multiple facts about a single entity (the country) within one statement, rather than as separate, disjointed sentences. This directly addresses the feedback from the evaluation, which indicated that the generated text often consisted of a list of facts.  The inclusion of language adds further context and improves the overall coherence of the output."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_62\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
