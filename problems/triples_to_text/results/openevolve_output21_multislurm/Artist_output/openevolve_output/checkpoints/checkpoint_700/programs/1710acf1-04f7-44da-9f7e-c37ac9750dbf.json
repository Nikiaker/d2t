constructs a list of facts about a country (`country_info`) and then joins them with commas.  This can lead to choppy sentences. The revised code directly incorporates these facts into a more flowing sentence structure using \"which has,\" \"where,\" and other connecting phrases. This should improve the coherence and readability of the generated text, leading to a better BLEU score.  I've removed the intermediate list and directly built the combined sentence.
