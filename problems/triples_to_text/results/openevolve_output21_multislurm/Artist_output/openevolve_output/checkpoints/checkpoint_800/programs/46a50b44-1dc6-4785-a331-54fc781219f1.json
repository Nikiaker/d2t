data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

The revised code proactively searches for capital, language, and demonym information. It then constructs a more comprehensive sentence by incorporating all available information into a single clause using \"where\" and a comma-separated list of facts. This results in a more fluent and informative sentence, increasing the likelihood of a higher BLUE score.  It also removes the redundant check for the existence of \"capital\" predicate as the logic already handles the case where none of the country information is available.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_285\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
