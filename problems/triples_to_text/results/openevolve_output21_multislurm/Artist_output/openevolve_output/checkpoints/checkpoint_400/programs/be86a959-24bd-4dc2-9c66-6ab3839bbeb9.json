Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

`if/elif` blocks to handle different combinations of country-related information. This was unnecessarily verbose and didn't contribute to more natural language. The improved version simplifies this by first collecting all available information (capital, language, currency, demonym) into a list called `description`. Then, it checks if the `description` list is empty. If it's not empty, it joins the elements of the list with commas and includes them in a single sentence. This results in a more concise and readable sentence that incorporates multiple facts about the country. If the list is empty, it defaults to a simple sentence stating that the subject is located in the country. This change should help to produce sentences that are more similar to the example sentences provided in the prompt, potentially increasing the BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_311\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
