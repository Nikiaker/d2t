Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

It then constructs a more comprehensive sentence if all three are found, combining multiple facts into one statement.  This addresses the previous tendency to create separate, short sentences.\n*   **More Conditional Logic:** Added additional conditions to handle cases where only some of the country's attributes (capital, language, currency) are available, creating more nuanced sentences.\n*   **Improved Fluency:** Combining information leads to more natural-sounding sentences.\n\nThis change directly addresses the prompt's request for more complex sentence generation and should lead to a higher BLEU score by better capturing the relationships between entities."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_154\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
