Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

The improved code directly constructs more complex sentence structures using \"which has...\", \"is where...\", and \"and its people are called...\" clauses when all three pieces of information (capital, language, demonym) are available. This aims to create a more fluent and natural-sounding sentence, mimicking the example provided in the prompt.
