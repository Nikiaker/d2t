data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

By including the demonym in the generated sentence when available, we create a more comprehensive and informative statement.  This aims to address the prompt's request for combining multiple triples into a single, complex sentence, leading to a potentially higher BLUE score by better capturing the relationships within the data.  The added conditional statements ensure that the sentence remains grammatically correct even if only some of these related triples are present."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_103\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
