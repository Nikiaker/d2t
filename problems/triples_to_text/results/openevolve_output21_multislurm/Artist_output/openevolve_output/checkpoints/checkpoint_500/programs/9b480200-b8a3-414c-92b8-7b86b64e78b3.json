"You are an expert data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input.

`if/elif` blocks to handle different combinations of country-related information (capital, language, demonym). This makes the code less readable and harder to maintain.  The improved code consolidates this logic into a single block.\n\n1.  **Collect Information:** It first retrieves the capital, language, and demonym if they exist in the `triples`.\n2.  **Build a Description List:** It then creates a `description` list containing strings for each available piece of information.\n3.  **Join and Append:** Finally, it joins the elements of the `description` list with commas and appends the resulting string to the `sentence`. If `description` is empty, it defaults to the simpler \"is in\" statement. This change aims to create more complex and natural-sounding sentences when multiple facts about a country are available, improving the overall coherence of the generated text. The slight change to the ethnic group sentence improves readability.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_363\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
