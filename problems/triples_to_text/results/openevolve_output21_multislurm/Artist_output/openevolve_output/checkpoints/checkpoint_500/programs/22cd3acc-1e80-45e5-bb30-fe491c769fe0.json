This change extends this logic to also check for a \"demonym\" triple. If all three (capital, language, and demonym) are found, it combines them into a single, more informative sentence. This addresses the prompt's requirement to create more complex sentences by incorporating more information from related triples into a single statement. The additional `elif` conditions cover combinations of two of these attributes, ensuring graceful handling even if all three aren't present. This improves coherence and potentially increases the BLEU score by more closely matching the expected output style."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_10\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
