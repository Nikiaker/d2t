data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

capital and a language, only a capital, or only a language.  This resulted in slightly different sentence structures. The revised code consolidates these into a single approach.\n\n1.  **`country_info` List:** It creates a list called `country_info` to store relevant phrases about the country (e.g., \"its capital is London\", \"and French is an official language\").\n2.  **Conditional Appending:**  It conditionally appends phrases to the `country_info` list based on whether the capital and language information are available in the triples.\n3.  **`\", \".join(country_info)`:**  It joins the phrases in the `country_info` list with a comma and a space to create a single, more comprehensive clause.  This leads to a more fluent sentence when multiple facts about the country are present.\n4.  **Simplified Sentence Construction:** The final sentence construction is simplified, using the joined `country_info` to add the details in a consistent way.\n\nThis change aims to create more natural and informative sentences when dealing with multiple related facts, potentially improving the BLEU score by generating outputs closer to the reference sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_61\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
