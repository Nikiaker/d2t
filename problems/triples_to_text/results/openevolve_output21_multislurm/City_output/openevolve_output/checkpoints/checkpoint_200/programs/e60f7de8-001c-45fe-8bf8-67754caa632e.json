Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

By replacing some of these with more natural conjunctions like \"which\", \"where\", \"and\", and restructuring the sentence flow, the generated text should become more readable and coherent, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score. Replacing the trailing comma with a period also helps create more complete sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_136\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
