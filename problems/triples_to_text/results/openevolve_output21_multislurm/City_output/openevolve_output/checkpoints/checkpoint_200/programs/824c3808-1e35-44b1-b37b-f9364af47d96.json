Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This results in a very choppy and unnatural sounding output. By adding a connector (\", and \") between each sentence, the output will flow more smoothly and be more grammatically correct. Also, slightly modifying the sentence structure to remove redundant phrases like \"The\" at the beginning of each statement will improve readability. Removing the loop index 'i' which was unused, also contributes to cleaner code. The addition of `connector = \"\"` and the logic for adding it to the sentence at"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_30\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
