Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\nKey changes and reasoning:\n\n*   **Removed `first` flag:** The `first` flag was redundant. We can determine the first triple simply by checking `i == 0`.\n*   **Improved sentence starters:** Replaced repetitive phrases like \"sentence += f\"{triple.subject} \" with more natural-sounding sentence beginnings (\"It\", \"Its\").\n*   **Simplified conditional logic:** The structure is slightly more concise and readable.\n*   **Better punctuation:** Using periods at the end of each phrase rather than commas, making it more readable.\n*   **Removed trailing comma/period:**  `strip(\", \")` changed to `strip(\". \")` to handle the cases where the last triple ends with a period instead of a comma.\n*   **Subject reference:** Using \"It\" to refer back to the initial subject instead of repeating the subject's name, leading to better flow. This is especially important when multiple triples describe the same entity.\n*   **More natural phrasing:** Minor adjustments to phrasing for better readability (e.g., \"Its capital is...\" instead of \"and the capital is...\").\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_57\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
