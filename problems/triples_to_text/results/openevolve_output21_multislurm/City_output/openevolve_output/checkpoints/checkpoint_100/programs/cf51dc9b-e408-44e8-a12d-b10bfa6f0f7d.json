Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code appends \", \" after almost every phrase, leading to choppy and unnatural sentences. This change aims to:\n\n*   **Replace repetitive connectors:**  Instead of constantly using \", \", more varied sentence structures are used (e.g., \"which is part of...\", \"Its UTC offset is...\").\n*   **Use full stops:** Ending phrases with a full stop creates more complete thoughts.\n*   **Improve phrasing:**  Some phrases are reworded to sound more natural (e.g., \"led by a {triple.object}\" -> \"It is led by {triple.object}\").\n\nThese small changes can significantly improve the fluency and readability of the generated text, which should positively impact the BLEU score.  The goal is to move away from a list-like sentence structure towards a more coherent paragraph."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_132\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
