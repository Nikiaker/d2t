Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

\"and is part of\" with \", which is part of\" to create a more natural phrasing.\n*   Adding \"and\" before some clauses to improve readability and connect ideas better.\n*   Adding units to some values (e.g., \"meters\" to elevation) for clarity.\n*   Rephrasing some clauses to sound more natural (e.g., \"with {triple.object} as its largest city\").\n*   Using \"and is home to\" for ethnic groups.\n*   The goal is to reduce the repetitive \"and\" at the beginning of clauses and create a more coherent, readable sentence.  These small adjustments should help the generated text sound less like a list of facts and more like a natural description."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_54\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
