Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

\"is located in\" for `isPartOf`, which can lead to awkward phrasing when combined with other information.  The proposed change introduces a conditional check:\n\n1. **If a sentence already exists:** It appends \"which is part of\" to create a relative clause, making the sentence flow more naturally (e.g., \"Albany, Oregon is in Oregon which is part of the United States\").\n2. **If it's the first triple:** It starts with a more direct statement (e.g., \"Albany, Oregon is part of Oregon\").\n\nThis modification addresses a common issue in the current program's output, where sentences sound disjointed due to repetitive phrasing and improper use of relative clauses.
