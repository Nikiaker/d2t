Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This can lead to repetitive and awkward phrasing when a city is part of multiple counties or states.\n\nThe suggested change addresses this by:\n\n1.  **Checking for existing \"is located in\"**: Before adding the `isPartOf` phrase, it checks if the sentence already contains \"is located in\".\n2.  **Conditional phrasing**: If \"is located in\" is not present, it adds \"is part of\". If it *is* present, it adds \"and also part of\" to create a smoother continuation of the sentence.\n3.  **Improved UTC offset phrasing:** Changed \"is located at UTC\" to \"has a UTC offset of\" to sound more natural.\n\nThis change aims to improve the readability and naturalness of the generated sentences, especially when dealing with multiple relationships of the same type, which should improve the BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_89\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
