Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

logic to add \"which is part of\" or \"and is part of\" based on the presence of \"located in\" or \"is in\" in the sentence. This is a good start, but the commas improve readability and sentence flow. Adding a comma before \"which is part of\" and \"and is part of\" makes the sentence sound more natural. Also, adding \"is\" before \"part of\" in the else case improves sentence structure.
