Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: areaOfWater - Example triple: (Abilene, Texas | areaOfWater | 14.2 (square kilometres))\nPredicate: areaTotal - Example triple: (Abilene, Texas | areaTotal | 286.5 (square kilometres))\nPredicate: country - Example triple: (Abilene, Texas | country | United States)\nPredicate: elevationAboveTheSeaLevel - Example triple: (Abilene, Texas | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 524.0)\nPredicate: isPartOf - Example triple: (Abilene, Texas | isPartOf | Jones County, Texas)\nPredicate: populationDensity - Example triple: (Abilene, Texas | populationDensity | 429.9 (inhabitants per square kilometre))\nPredicate: areaCode - Example triple: (Akron, Ohio | areaCode | 234, 330)\nPredicate: leaderTitle - Example triple: (Akron, Ohio | leaderTitle | Mayor)\nPredicate: areaOfLand - Example triple: (Albuquerque, New Mexico | areaOfLand | 486.2 (square kilometres))\nPredicate: leader - Example triple: (Albuquerque, New Mexico | leader | Richard J. Berry)\nPredicate: utcOffset - Example triple: (Anaheim, California | utcOffset | \"-7\")\nPredicate: populationTotal - Example triple: (Anaheim, California | populationTotal | 336265)\nPredicate: postalCode - Example triple: (Antioch, California | postalCode | 94509, 94531)\nPredicate: largestCity - Example triple: (Benton County, Oregon | largestCity | Corvallis, Oregon)\nPredicate: language - Example triple: (California | language | Chinese language)\nPredicate: location - Example triple: (California State Assembly | location | California State Capitol)\nPredicate: chairperson - Example triple: (Democratic Party (United States) | chairperson | Debbie Wasserman Schultz)\nPredicate: headquarter - Example triple: (Democratic Party (United States) | headquarter | South Capitol Street)\nPredicate: countySeat - Example triple: (Fountain County, Indiana | countySeat | Covington, Indiana)\nPredicate: capital - Example triple: (Georgia (U.S. state) | capital | Atlanta)\nPredicate: demonym - Example triple: (United States | demonym | Americans)\nPredicate: ethnicGroup - Example triple: (United States | ethnicGroup | African Americans)\nPredicate: state - Example triple: (Lee County, Alabama | state | Alabama)\nPredicate: populationMetro - Example triple: (Ciudad Ayala | populationMetro | 1777539)\nPredicate: type - Example triple: (Ciudad Ayala | type
