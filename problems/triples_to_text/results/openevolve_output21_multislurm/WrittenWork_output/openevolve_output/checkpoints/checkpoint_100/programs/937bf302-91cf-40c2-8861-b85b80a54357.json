Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

check:**  This simplifies the loop and allows for more flexible sentence construction.\n*   **Used a list to accumulate clauses:** Instead of concatenating strings directly, we build a list of clauses. This allows for better control over the final sentence structure and avoids awkward phrasing.\n*   **Improved clause phrasing:** The individual clauses are now more grammatically correct and natural-sounding (e.g., \"The ISBN number of... is...\" instead of \"...has ISBN...\").\n*   **Used `, ` to join clauses:** This creates a more readable sentence with multiple pieces of information.\n*   **Removed `.strip()`:** The `.join()` method already handles leading/trailing spaces, so `.strip()` is redundant.\n*   **Added `numberOfPages` to the if/elif chain:** Added a clause for the `numberOfPages` predicate to improve coverage.\n*   **More general else clause:** The `else` clause now uses a more generic phrasing (\"{subject}'s {predicate} is {object_}\") to handle unknown predicates gracefully. This prevents the program from breaking if it encounters a predicate it doesn't explicitly recognize.\n\nThis approach should result in more coherent and grammatically correct sentences, leading to a higher BLEU score. The use of clauses makes the code more extensible and easier to maintain."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_51\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
