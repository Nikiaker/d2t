The change replaces \"and its\" with \"which has\", \"and is a\", \"and is preceded by\", \"and is followed by\", and \"which is in the field of\" to create more fluent relative clauses.  This leads to more complex sentences that better reflect the relationships between the data points. Adding \"which\" or \"and is\" improves grammatical flow and helps combine information from multiple triples into a single, coherent sentence. This should improve the BLEU score by generating sentences closer to the example sentences.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if predicate == \"numberOfPages\":\n                sentence += f\"has {object_} pages\"\n            elif predicate == \"mediaType\":\n                sentence += f\"is a {object_}\"\n            elif predicate == \"precededBy\":\n                sentence += f\"and is preceded by {object_}\"\n            elif predicate == \"followedBy\":\n                sentence += f\"and is followed by {object_}\"\n            elif predicate == \"academicDiscipline\":\n                sentence += f\"and belongs to the field of {object_}\"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\" and its {predicate} is {object_}\"\n=======\n        else:\n            if predicate == \"numberOfPages\":\n                sentence += f\"which has {object_} pages \"\n            elif predicate == \"mediaType\":\n                sentence += f\"and is a {object_} \"\n            elif predicate == \"precededBy\":\n                sentence += f\"and is preceded by {object_} \"\n            elif predicate == \"followedBy\":\n                sentence += f\"and is followed by {object_} \"\n            elif predicate == \"academicDiscipline\":\n                sentence += f\"which is in the field of {object_} \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"and its {predicate} is {object_} \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_81\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
