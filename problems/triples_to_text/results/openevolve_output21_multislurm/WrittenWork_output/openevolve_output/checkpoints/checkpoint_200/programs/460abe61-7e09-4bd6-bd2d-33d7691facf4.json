Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This leads to repetitive and unnatural sentence structures. The suggested change introduces more specific phrasing for key predicates (followedBy, precededBy, influencedBy, ethnicGroup, language, country, capital, leader, author, genre) to create a more fluent and contextually appropriate sentence.  By using phrases like \"followed by\", \"whose capital is\", and \"written by\", the generated sentences will more closely resemble natural language, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score. This addresses the issue of the program producing very basic and repetitive sentences. It prioritizes handling the most frequent predicates with more sophisticated phrasing.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_177\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
