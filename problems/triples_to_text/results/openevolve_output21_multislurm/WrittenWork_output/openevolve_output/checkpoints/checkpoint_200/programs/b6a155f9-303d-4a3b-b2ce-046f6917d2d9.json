Changes:**\n\nThe original code only processed the first triple. This change iterates through all the triples in the input list and constructs a sentence by appending clauses based on the predicate of each triple.  It uses a series of `if/elif/else` statements to handle each possible predicate, generating appropriate text for each one. The `strip()` method is added at the end to remove leading/trailing whitespace.  This will allow the function to handle more complex inputs and produce more informative sentences, significantly improving the BLUE score.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_127\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
