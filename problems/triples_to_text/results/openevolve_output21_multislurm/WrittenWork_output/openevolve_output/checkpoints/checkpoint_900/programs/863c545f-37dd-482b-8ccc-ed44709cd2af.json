While functional, it could lead to awkward phrasing like \"...is in X, where the capital is Y.\"  The revised code integrates the capital information directly into the country description, creating a more fluent sentence: \"...is located in X, which has Y as its capital.\"  The separate \"capital\" predicate handling is removed because it's now redundant. This change should improve readability and potentially the BLEU score by aligning the generated text more closely with the example sentences.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            elif predicate == \"country\":\n                country = object_\n                capital_triple = next((t for t in triples if t.subject == country and t.predicate == \"capital\"), None)\n                if capital_triple:\n                    capital = capital_triple.object\n                    properties.append(f\"is in {country}, where the capital is {capital}\")\n                else:\n                    properties.append(f\"is located in {object_}\")\n            elif predicate == \"capital\":\n                # Skip capital as it's handled within the country logic\n                pass\n=======\n            elif predicate == \"country\":\n                country = object_\n                capital_triple = next((t for t in triples if t.subject == country and t.predicate == \"capital\"), None)\n                if capital_triple:\n                    capital = capital_triple.object\n                    properties.append(f\"is located in {country}, which has {capital} as its capital.\")\n                else:\n                    properties.append(f\"is located in {object_}\")\n            # Removed the capital handling, as it's already covered in the country logic\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_34\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
