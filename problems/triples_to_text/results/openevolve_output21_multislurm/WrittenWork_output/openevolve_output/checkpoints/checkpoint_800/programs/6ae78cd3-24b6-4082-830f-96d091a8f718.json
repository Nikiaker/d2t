Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

structure. This change aims to:\n\n1.  **Improve Phrasing:**  Uses more natural language like \"has X as its capital\" and \"is known for Y\".\n2.  **Sentence Flow:**  More consistent use of commas and periods for better readability.\n3.  **Conciseness:** Removed redundancy.\n4.  **Better Chaining:** Better integrates capital and language information into a single, flowing sentence when both are available.\n\nThis focused improvement should lead to more coherent and grammatically correct sentences, which should translate to a higher BLEU score.  The changes are limited to the `country` and `capital` predicate handling to minimize the risk of introducing new errors.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_132\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
