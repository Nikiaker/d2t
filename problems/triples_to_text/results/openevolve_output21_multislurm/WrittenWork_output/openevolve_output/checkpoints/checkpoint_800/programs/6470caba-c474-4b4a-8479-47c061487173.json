Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This change aims to improve that.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if i > 0:\n                # Attempt to connect to the previous triple\n                prev_predicate = triples[i-1].predicate\n                if prev_predicate == \"country\" and predicate == \"capital\":\n                    sentence += f\"which has {object_} as its capital \"\n                elif prev_predicate == \"language\" and predicate == \"spokenIn\":\n                    sentence += f\"and is spoken in {object_} \"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\"and {object_} \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"is related to {object_} \"\n=======\n        else:\n            if i > 0:\n                # Attempt to connect to the previous triple\n                prev_predicate = triples[i-1].predicate\n                prev_subject = triples[i-1].subject\n\n                if prev_predicate == \"country\" and subject == prev_subject and predicate == \"capital\":\n                    sentence += f\"which has {object_} as its capital \"\n                elif prev_predicate == \"language\" and subject == prev_subject and predicate == \"spokenIn\":\n                    sentence += f\"and is spoken in {object_} \"\n                elif prev_predicate == \"country\" and subject == prev_subject:\n                    sentence += f\"which is in {object_} \"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\"and {object_} \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"is {object_} \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Change:**\n\nThe key addition is checking if the `subject` of the current triple is the same as the `subject` of the previous triple (`prev_subject == subject`). This ensures that we're only attempting to connect properties *of the same entity*.  Also, I've added a condition to connect `country` and the following property if the subject is the same.\n\nThe change from `is related to` to `is` in the `else` block of the original code when `i == 0` makes the sentence sound more natural.\n\nThis change will help the program create more grammatically correct and logically connected sentences, particularly when dealing with multiple properties of the same entity, and should improve the BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_39\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
