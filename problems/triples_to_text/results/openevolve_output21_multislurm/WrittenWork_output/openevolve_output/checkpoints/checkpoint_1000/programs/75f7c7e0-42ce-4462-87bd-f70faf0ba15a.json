The revised code aims to create a more natural flow by:\n\n1.  Using \"is located in\" instead of \"is in\" for a more formal tone.\n2.  Modifying the replacement logic within the `capital` block to explicitly state \"which has {capital\\_obj} as its capital\" for better readability and grammatical correctness.\n3.  Changing the `else` condition to \"and its capital is {capital\\_obj}\" to handle cases where the country is not already mentioned, making the sentence flow more smoothly.\n\nThis change should result in sentences that more closely resemble the example correct sentences, improving the BLEU score by producing more human-like and contextually appropriate text.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            elif predicate == \"country\":\n                country_obj = object_\n                properties.append(f\"is in {country_obj}\")\n                country_key = \"country\"\n            elif predicate == \"capital\":\n                capital_obj = object_\n                if \"country\" in properties:\n                    country_index = properties.index(f\"is in {country_obj}\")\n                    properties[country_index] = f\"is in {country_obj}, whose capital is {capital_obj}\"\n                else:\n                    properties.append(f\", whose capital is {capital_obj}\")\n=======\n            elif predicate == \"country\":\n                country_obj = object_\n                properties.append(f\"is located in {country_obj}\")\n                country_key = \"country\"\n            elif predicate == \"capital\":\n                capital_obj = object_\n                if \"is located in\" in properties:\n                    country_index = properties.index(f\"is located in {country_obj}\")\n                    properties[country_index] = f\"is located in {country_obj}, which has {capital_obj} as its capital.\"\n                else:\n                    properties.append(f\" and its capital is {capital_obj}\")\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_39\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
