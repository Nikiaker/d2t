Replacing it with \"which has a capital of\" sounds more natural. Also, changing \"is in\" to \"is located in\" and \"has a capital of\" to \"has a capital city of\" improves the phrasing. This aims to improve fluency and potentially the BLEU score by generating sentences closer to the reference sentences.
