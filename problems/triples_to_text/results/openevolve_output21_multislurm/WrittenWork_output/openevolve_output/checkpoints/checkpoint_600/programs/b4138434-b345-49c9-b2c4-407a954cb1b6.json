Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

{country}, which has the capital city of {capital_triple.object} \"` to sound more natural.\n*   **Capital Handling:**  Added a clause to handle the `capital` predicate even if it wasn't linked to a country triple. This ensures that if a capital is mentioned directly, it's included in the sentence, prefaced with \"and its capital is\". This addresses cases where the capital information isn't explicitly tied to a country in the triples.\n*   **Conjunction Handling:** Added `if sentence:` check to ensure that \"and\" is only added when the sentence is not empty. This makes the sentence flow better.\n\nThis change aims to improve the fluency and completeness of the generated sentences, especially when dealing with related facts like country and capital.
