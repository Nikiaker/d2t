Currently, it simply states \"The capital is {object_}\". The improvement adds a check to see if a `country` triple exists with the capital city as its subject. If it does, it combines this information into a single, more natural sentence: \"{object_} is the capital of {country_triple.object}.\" This creates a more complex and informative sentence when both pieces of information are present in the input triples.
