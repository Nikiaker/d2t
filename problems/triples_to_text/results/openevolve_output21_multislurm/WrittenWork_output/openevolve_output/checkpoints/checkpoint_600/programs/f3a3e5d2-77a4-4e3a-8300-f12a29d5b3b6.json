Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This resulted in disjointed sentences.\n\nThe improved code checks if the preceding triple's predicate was \"country\". If so, it modifies the existing sentence to incorporate the capital information directly into the previous clause using \", whose capital is {object_}.\".  This creates a more fluent and natural sentence structure like \"Antwerp is in Belgium, whose capital is Brussels.\"  If the preceding triple isn't about the country, it falls back to the original phrasing, ensuring the code still works for cases where the triples aren't ordered as country then capital.
