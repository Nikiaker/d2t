Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

iterated through triples and created a sentence by appending individual statements for each triple. This results in a series of short, choppy sentences. The improved code groups information by subject. It creates a dictionary `combined_info` where keys are subjects and values are dictionaries of their properties (predicate-object pairs). Then, it iterates through this dictionary and constructs a single sentence for each subject, combining all its properties into a more complex and natural-sounding statement using \", \" as a separator. This approach should lead to a higher BLEU score by generating sentences that are more similar to the example correct sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_71\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
