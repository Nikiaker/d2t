The proposed change introduces conditional logic to handle multiple details more gracefully.\n\n- **If `details` has more than one element:** It joins all but the last detail with \", \", adds \", and \" before the last detail, and appends a period. This creates a more natural flow, similar to the example sentences provided.\n- **If `details` has only one element:** It simply uses the single detail and adds a period, avoiding unnecessary conjunctions.\n\nThis small change aims to improve the coherence of the generated sentences, making them more readable and closer to the expected output format, which should lead to a higher BLEU score. It addresses the issue of the program producing a series of disconnected facts instead of a unified sentence.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    sentence = \" \".join(details) + \".\"\n=======\n    if len(details) > 1:\n        sentence = \", \".join(details[:-1]) + \", and \" + details[-1] + \".\"\n    else:\n        sentence = details[0] + \".\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_79\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
