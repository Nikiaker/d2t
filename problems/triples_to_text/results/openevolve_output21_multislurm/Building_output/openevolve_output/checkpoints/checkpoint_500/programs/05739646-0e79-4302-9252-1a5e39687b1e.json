This improvement specifically handles the \"capital\" predicate and its relationship with the \"country\" predicate.\n\n1.  **Handles \"capital\" predicate:**  If the predicate is \"capital\", it constructs a sentence like \"{subject} is the capital of {object}\".\n\n2.  **Handles \"country\" in conjunction with \"capital\":** If the predicate is \"country\" and there's a \"capital\" triple present, it creates a more complex sentence like \"{subject}, which is in {object}, has {capital_subject} as its capital.\" This links the country and capital information more naturally.\n\n3.  **Fallback:** If neither of the above conditions is met, it falls back to the original, less sophisticated `\"{subject} {predicate} {object}\"` format.\n\nThis change aims to improve the program's ability to create more coherent and informative sentences when triples related to country and capital are present, which is a common pattern in building-related knowledge graphs.  This should lead to a higher BLEU score by generating sentences closer to the expected output.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            else:\n                details.append(f\"which {triple.predicate} {triple.object}\")\n=======\n            else:\n                if triple.predicate == \"capital\":\n                    details.append(f\"{triple.subject} is the capital of {triple.object}\")\n                elif triple.predicate == \"country\" and any(t.predicate == \"capital\" for t in triples):\n                    capital_triple = next((t for t in triples if t.predicate == \"capital\"), None)\n                    if capital_triple:\n                        details.append(f\"{triple.subject}, which is in {triple.object}, has {capital_triple.subject} as its capital.\")\n                    else:\n                        details.append(f\"{triple.subject} is located in {triple.object}\")\n                else:\n                    details.append(f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}\")\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_73\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
