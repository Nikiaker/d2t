This is very basic and doesn't create meaningful connections between triples.\n\nThe change adds more specific logic to handle \"leader\" and \"origin\" predicates *in conjunction with* a \"country\" predicate.  If a \"country\" triple exists, it constructs a more informative sentence like \"{subject} is the leader of {country}\" or \"{subject} is from {country}\". This improves coherence and makes better use of the available information, leading to a higher BLEU score.  The `else` clause ensures that if a country triple is not available the original behavior is maintained.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            else:\n                details.append(f\"{triple.predicate} {triple.object}\")\n=======\n            else:\n                if triple.predicate == \"leader\" and any(t.predicate == \"country\" for t in triples):\n                    country_triple = next((t for t in triples if t.predicate == \"country\"), None)\n                    if country_triple:\n                        details.append(f\"{triple.subject} is the leader of {country_triple.object}\")\n                    else:\n                        details.append(f\"{triple.subject} is a leader\")\n                elif triple.predicate == \"origin\" and any(t.predicate == \"country\" for t in triples):\n                    country_triple = next((t for t in triples if t.predicate == \"country\"), None)\n                    if country_triple:\n                        details.append(f\"{triple.subject} is from {country_triple.object}\")\n                    else:\n                        details.append(f\"{triple.subject} has an origin\")\n                else:\n                    details.append(f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}\")\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_4\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
