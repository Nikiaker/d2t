Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This often resulted in grammatically awkward and less fluent sentences.\n\nThe revised code does the following:\n\n1.  **Creates a list of sentence parts:** Instead of building the sentence incrementally, it creates a list called `parts`, where each triple is transformed into a self-contained sentence fragment.\n2.  **Handles all predicates:** It includes `if/elif` blocks for *all* possible predicates, ensuring that each triple type is handled consistently.\n3.  **Joins with commas:**  Finally, it joins the elements of the `parts` list with \", \" to create a single, more complex sentence. This is a more natural way to combine multiple facts about a single subject.\n4. **Handles empty triples list:** Added a check for an empty list of triples to prevent errors.\n\nThis approach is expected to significantly improve the fluency and grammatical correctness of the generated sentences, leading to a higher BLEU score.
