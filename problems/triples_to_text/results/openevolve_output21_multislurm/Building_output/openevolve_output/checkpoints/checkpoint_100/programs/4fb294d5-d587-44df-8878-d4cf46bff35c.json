Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence.

**Conditional Sentence Building:**  It uses `if/elif/else` statements to handle different predicate types.  For each predicate, it adds a specific phrase to the `sentence` string.\n*   **Handling Unknown Predicates:** An `else` clause is added to handle cases where the predicate is not recognized, providing a fallback phrase.\n*   **More Contextual Phrases:**  The phrases are designed to be more natural and incorporate the triple information into a more readable sentence structure.\n\nThis improvement should significantly increase the BLUE score by generating more complex and informative sentences that utilize more of the input data.
