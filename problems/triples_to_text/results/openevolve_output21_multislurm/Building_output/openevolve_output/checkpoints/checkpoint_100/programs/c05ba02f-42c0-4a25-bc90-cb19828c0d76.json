Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

and \"The\" prefixes for better fluency.\n*   Changed the joiner from \", \" to \" \" to create a more natural flow in the sentence.\n*   Simplified phrasing for better readability (e.g., \"Its height is...\" to \"{subject} is... high\").\n*   Corrected indentation issue.\n\nThis change aims to create more concise and natural-sounding sentences by reducing redundancy and improving the overall structure. It will also help in forming more complex sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"error_type\": \"IndentationError\", \"error_message\": \"unindent does not match any outer indentation level (tmpm3quctfy.py, line 34)\", \"full_traceback\": \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \\\"/home/inf151915/d2t/problems/triples_to_text/evaluator.py\\\", line 121, in evaluate\\n    spec.loader.exec_module(program)\\n  File \\\"<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>\\\", line 995, in exec_module\\n  File \\\"<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>\\\", line 1133, in get_code\\n  File \\\"<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>\\\", line 1063, in source_to_code\\n  File \\\"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\\\", line 488, in _call_with_frames_removed\\n  File \\\"/tmp/tmpm3quctfy.py\\\", line 34\\n    def build_sentence(subject, related_info):\\n                                              ^\\nIndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level\\n\", \"suggestion\": \"Check for syntax errors or missing imports in the generated code\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
