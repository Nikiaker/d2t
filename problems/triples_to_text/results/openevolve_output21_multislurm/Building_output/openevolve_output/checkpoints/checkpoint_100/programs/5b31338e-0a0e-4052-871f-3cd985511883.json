Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

the subject in every sentence fragment.\n*   **Combining Information:** It attempts to combine location and architect information into a single sentence when available.\n*   **More Complex Sentence Structure:**  The code now creates sentences like \"\\[Subject] is located in \\[Location]. It was designed by \\[Architect]. \\[Other details].\"\n*   **Removed Default \"and\" clause:** The default \"and\" clause is removed as it leads to grammatically incorrect sentences.\n*   **Reduced Redundancy:** Avoids repeating subject names unnecessarily.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"error_type\": \"AllTrialsFailed\", \"error_message\": \"All trials failed - common issues: timeouts, crashes, or invalid return values\", \"suggestion\": \"Check for infinite loops, ensure function returns a str\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
