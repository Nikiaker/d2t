Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: league - Example triple: (A.C.

simply joined sentences with commas and \"and\".  This improved version attempts to create a more natural flow by specifically handling predicates like \"country\" and \"isPartOf\" which often indicate a hierarchical relationship. When these predicates are encountered, the object value is integrated directly into the existing sentence using \"which is in\".  It also handles the \"league\" predicate in a similar way. This should result in more complex and contextually relevant sentences.  The `else` condition remains to handle other predicates by appending them as before, but the special cases prioritize better sentence structure where appropriate.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_65\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
