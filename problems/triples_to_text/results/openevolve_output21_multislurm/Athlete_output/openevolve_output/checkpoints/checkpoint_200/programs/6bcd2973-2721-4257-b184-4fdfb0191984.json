Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

Instead of always using a comma to separate all clauses, it introduces conditional logic:\n\n1.  **Single Clause:** If there's only one clause, it returns that clause directly with a period.\n2.  **Two Clauses:** If there are two clauses, it joins them with \"and\" for a more natural flow.\n3.  **Multiple Clauses:** If there are three or more clauses, it joins all but the last one with commas, and then adds \", and\" before the last clause, mimicking standard English sentence structure.\n\nThis simple change significantly improves the readability and grammatical correctness of sentences generated from multiple triples, which should result in a higher BLEU score.
