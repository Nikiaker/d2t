Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Improvement:**\n\nThe original code builds the sentence incrementally using string concatenation, which often results in awkward phrasing and lack of proper conjunctions. The suggested change replaces this with a list of individual sentence fragments.  Then it joins these fragments using \", \" and adds a period at the end, creating a more natural-sounding sentence. This approach allows for more flexibility and readability, especially when dealing with multiple triples. The logic is based on the inspiration program 2, which showed a better BLEU score than the original code. It also handles the case of a single triple more gracefully by adding a period.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_19\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
