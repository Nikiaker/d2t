Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

The revised code iterates through each triple and constructs a separate, simple sentence for each one.  Then, it joins these sentences together with spaces. This approach is more likely to generate grammatically correct and readable sentences, even when dealing with diverse triples, improving the BLEU score.  It avoids the complex conditional logic that was attempting to weave the information together in a single sentence, which often resulted in awkward phrasing.
