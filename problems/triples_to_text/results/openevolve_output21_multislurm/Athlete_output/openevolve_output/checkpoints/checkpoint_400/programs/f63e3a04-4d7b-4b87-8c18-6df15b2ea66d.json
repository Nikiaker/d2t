Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

The suggested change simplifies this by directly joining the clauses with \"and\". This creates a more concise and natural-sounding sentence, especially when dealing with multiple triples.  The removal of the `relative_clauses` list and the conditional logic related to `was born in`, `plays for` etc. streamlines the code and focuses on simply concatenating the clauses. This is expected to yield a better BLEU score by producing more human-like sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_62\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
