Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

While a good idea, it's limited and may not capture other relationships between triples.  The revised code simplifies this by directly joining all clauses with commas and \"and\" before the last clause, creating a more generally applicable sentence structure. This allows for more complex sentences to be generated without being overly specific about the relationships between clauses, which can lead to better fluency and a higher BLEU score. Removing the specific combination logic makes the code more robust and adaptable to a wider range of input triples."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_57\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
