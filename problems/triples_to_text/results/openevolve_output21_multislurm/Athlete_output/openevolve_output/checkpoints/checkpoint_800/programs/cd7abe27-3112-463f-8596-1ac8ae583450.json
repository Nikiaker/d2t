The revised code creates a list `sentence_parts` and appends clauses to that list. This allows for more flexible sentence construction.  The conditional logic for adding \"and\" or \"which is located in\" is preserved, but applied to the `sentence_parts` list.  Finally, the `sentence_parts` are joined into a single string. This change provides a better structure for building more complex sentences. This is a more modular approach to sentence construction, and will help the program better handle complex sentences. It will lead to a better BLUE score.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    sentence = f\"{triples[0].subject}\"\n    for i, clause in enumerate(clauses):\n        if i == 0:\n            sentence += f\" {clause}\"\n        elif i == len(clauses) - 1:\n            if \"country\" in clause or \"city\" in clause:\n                sentence += f\", which is in {clause.split('is from ')[-1] if 'is from' in clause else clause.split('is ')[-1]}\"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\" and {clause}\"\n        else:\n            sentence += f\", {clause}\"\n    sentence += \".\"\n=======\n    sentence = f\"{triples[0].subject}\"\n    if clauses:\n        sentence_parts = []\n        for i, clause in enumerate(clauses):\n            if i == 0:\n                sentence_parts.append(clause)\n            elif i == len(clauses) - 1:\n                if \"country\" in clause or \"city\" in clause:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\" which is located in {clause.split('is from ')[-1] if 'is from' in clause else clause.split('is ')[-1]}\")\n                else:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\" and {clause}\")\n            else:\n                sentence_parts.append(f\", {clause}\")\n        sentence += \" \".join(sentence_parts)\n    sentence += \".\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_167\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
