Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This is verbose and can lead to awkward phrasing.\n\nThe proposed change simplifies this by:\n\n1.  Using `\", \".join(clauses[:-1])` to join all clauses except the last one with commas.\n2.  Adding the last clause with \"and\" before it, if there's more than one clause.\n3.  Handling the case where there's only one clause more elegantly.\n\nThis approach results in more natural-sounding sentences, particularly when dealing with multiple triples, and reduces the need for post-processing replacements like `replace(\" and whose\", \", who\")`.  It directly builds the correct sentence structure without relying on potentially inaccurate string manipulations.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_100\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
