Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input.

with commas and \"and\".  This resulted in relatively simple sentences. The improved code constructs *relative clauses* (using \"who\" or \"whose\") which are then joined to the subject using commas and \"and\". This creates more complex and natural-sounding sentences that better reflect the relationships between the different pieces of information.  It also simplifies the logic and avoids unnecessary initializations. The use of relative clauses improves readability and grammatical correctness, which should lead to a higher BLUE score.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"timeout\": true, \"timeout_duration\": 300, \"failure_stage\": \"evaluation\", \"error_type\": \"timeout\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
