Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input.

This allows for more natural sentence structure by separating the individual pieces of information.  The `\", \".join(clauses) + \".\"` then combines these clauses with commas and a final period, resulting in a more readable and complex sentence.  I've also added a few more predicates to the conditional statements to handle a wider range of inputs. Using the subject in each clause improves readability. This approach is inspired by Inspiration 1 and 2, aiming for a more robust and fluent output."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_10\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
