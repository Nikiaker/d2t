Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

{object_val}\" clause for any predicate not explicitly handled. This leads to repetitive and often awkward phrasing, especially when dealing with multiple triples. The proposed change introduces specific handling for predicates like \"utcOffset\", \"timeZone\", \"areaTotal\" and \"foundingDate\" to generate more natural and informative clauses. If none of the specific predicates match, it falls back to the original \"whose {predicate} is {object_val}\" clause, which is generally better than \"who...is\" for most cases. This will improve the coherence and readability of the generated sentences and should lead to a higher BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_17\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
