Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

that tried to build the sentence iteratively. The revised code simplifies this.  It removes the initial `clauses` list approach. Instead, it directly builds the sentence within the loop, adding conjunctions (\"and\") appropriately to connect different pieces of information. This should lead to more grammatically correct and fluent sentences, particularly when dealing with multiple triples. The initial part of the loop ensures the first triple is handled correctly. The subsequent triples are then appended with \"and\" to create a more cohesive sentence structure. Also, I removed the unnecessary `sentence = f\"{subject} \"` and added the subject directly within the loop.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_81\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
