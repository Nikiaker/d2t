The revised code replaces this with a more specific handling of predicates and introduces relative clauses (\"who\") for the general case.  Specifically, the replacements aim to improve readability and flow. For example, \"was born in\" becomes \"from\" for birthPlace, and  \"started their career in\" is used for `activeYearsStartYear`.  This should result in more natural-sounding sentences and a higher BLEU score by better matching reference sentences.  The improved handling of the predicates will make the generated text closer to the examples.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    clauses.append(f\"whose {predicate} is {object_val}\")\n=======\n    if predicate == \"league\":\n        clauses.append(f\"plays in {object_val}\")\n    elif predicate == \"manager\":\n        clauses.append(f\"is managed by {object_val}\")\n    elif predicate == \"birthDate\":\n        clauses.append(f\"was born on {object_val}\")\n    elif predicate == \"birthPlace\":\n        clauses.append(f\"from {object_val}\")\n    elif predicate == \"currentclub\":\n        clauses.append(f\"currently plays for {object_val}\")\n    elif predicate == \"birthYear\":\n        clauses.append(f\"born in {object_val}\")\n    elif predicate == \"club\":\n        clauses.append(f\"plays for {object_val}\")\n    elif predicate == \"country\":\n        clauses.append(f\"is from {object_val}\")\n    elif predicate == \"height\":\n        clauses.append(f\"is {object_val} tall\")\n    elif predicate == \"deathPlace\":\n        clauses.append(f\"died in {object_val}\")\n    elif predicate == \"activeYearsStartYear\":\n        clauses.append(f\"started their career in {object_val}\")\n    else:\n        clauses.append(f\"who {predicate} is {object_val}\")\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_78\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
