Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

the sentence in the first iteration, we now just add the subject. This allows us to integrate birthDate or birthPlace directly into the initial sentence structure for a more natural flow.\n*   **Improved phrasing:**  Minor adjustments to phrasing (e.g., \"managed by\" instead of \"who is managed by\") to improve readability.\n*   **Birthplace and Birthdate handled in initial triple:** We handle birthdate and birthplace in the first iteration to create a more fluent sentence.\n\nThis approach aims to create more cohesive sentences by better integrating the information from the first triple into the overall structure, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score by more closely matching the reference sentences.
