Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This makes the generated sentence more readable and grammatically correct, especially when dealing with multiple triples.  The previous logic for \"and\" only applied to the last two clauses, which often sounded awkward. This simpler approach consistently adds commas between all clauses. The initial subject is also prepended with a space for better formatting. This small change has the potential to significantly improve fluency and therefore the BLUE score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_76\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
