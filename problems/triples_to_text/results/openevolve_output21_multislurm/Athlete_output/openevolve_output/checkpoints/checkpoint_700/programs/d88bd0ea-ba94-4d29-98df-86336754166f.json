Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This approach, while functional, can lead to a somewhat rigid and repetitive sentence structure.\n\nThe improved code utilizes `\", \".join(clauses)` to create a comma-separated string of all clauses. Then, it replaces \", and \" with \" and \" to avoid awkward phrasing when the last clause is joined with \"and\".  This simplifies the logic and allows for more fluid sentence construction.  Adding an `else` statement to simply add a period if there are no clauses prevents errors. This change is expected to generate more natural-sounding and complex sentences, improving the BLEU score.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_138\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
