This can lead to awkward phrasing, especially with longer lists of triples.  The proposed change replaces the comma-separated list with \"who\" followed by the comma-separated list. This creates a more natural flow, resembling relative clauses, which is common in describing entities with multiple attributes.  This should lead to sentences that are closer to the reference sentences used for BLEU score calculation.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    sentence = f\"{triples[0].subject}\"\n    if clauses:\n        sentence += \" \" + \", \".join(clauses[:-1])\n        if len(clauses) > 1:\n            sentence += f\" and {clauses[-1]}\"\n        else:\n            sentence += f\" {clauses[0]}\"\n    sentence += \".\"\n=======\n    sentence = f\"{triples[0].subject}\"\n    if clauses:\n        sentence += \" who \" + \", \".join(clauses)\n    sentence += \".\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"timeout\": true, \"timeout_duration\": 300, \"failure_stage\": \"evaluation\", \"error_type\": \"timeout\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
