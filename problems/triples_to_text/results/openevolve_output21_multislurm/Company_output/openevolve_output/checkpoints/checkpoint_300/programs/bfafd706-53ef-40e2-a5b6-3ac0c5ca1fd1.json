It handles a wider range of predicates and attempts to create a more natural-sounding sentence by combining information from multiple triples.  The addition of conditional statements for each predicate allows for specific sentence constructions for each relation. The initial subject is also stored to be used in later predicates.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef predict(triples: list[Triple]) -> str:\n
