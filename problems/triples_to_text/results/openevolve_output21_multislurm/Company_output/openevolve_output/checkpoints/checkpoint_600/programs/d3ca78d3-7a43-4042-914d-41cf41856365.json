The improved code adds a more sophisticated attempt to combine information.\n\n1.  **`other_triples`**: It finds all triples that share the same subject as the current triple but have a different predicate.\n2.  **`combined_info`**: It then iterates through these related triples.  Critically, it includes some *specific* logic to combine certain predicate pairs that make semantic sense (e.g., \"industry\" and \"product\"). This helps to form more natural-sounding phrases.\n3.  **Conditional Sentence Construction**: If it finds related triples and can form a combined phrase, it constructs a more complex sentence.  Otherwise, it falls back to the original \"X is Y\" format, but including all the other information it found.\n\nThis change aims to address the common issue in the evaluation examples where the desired output combines information from multiple triples into a single, flowing sentence. By proactively attempting to do this, we expect to improve the BLUE score.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            sentences.append(f\"The {predicate} of {subject} is {object_value}.\")\n=======\n        else:\n            # Attempt to combine information for the same subject\n            other_triples = [t for t in triples if t.subject == subject and t.predicate != predicate]\n            if other_triples:\n                # Prioritize combining triples with related predicates\n                combined_info = []\n                for t in other_triples:\n                    if t.predicate == \"industry\" and predicate == \"product\":\n                        combined_info.append(f\"producing {t.object} in the {t.object} industry\")\n                    elif t.predicate == \"capital\" and predicate == \"country\":\n                        combined_info.append(f\"which has {t.object} as its capital\")\n                    elif t.predicate == \"regionServed\" and predicate == \"country\":\n                        combined_info.append(f\"serving the {t.object} region\")\n                    else:\n                        combined_info.append(f\"and its {t.predicate} is {t.object}\")\n\n                if combined_info:\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is \" + \" \".join(combined_info) + f\" and its {predicate} is {object_value}.\")\n                else:\n                    other_info = \", \".join([f\"{t.predicate} is {t.object}\" for t in other_triples])\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is {other_info} and its {predicate} is {object_value}.\")\n            else:\n                sentences.append(f\"{subject}'s {predicate} is {object_value}.\")\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_13\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
