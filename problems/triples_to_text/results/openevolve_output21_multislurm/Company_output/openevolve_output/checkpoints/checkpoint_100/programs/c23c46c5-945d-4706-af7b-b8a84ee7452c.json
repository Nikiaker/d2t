Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Company. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

for each one. This is simplistic and doesn't leverage relationships between different pieces of information.\n\nThe improved code:\n\n1.  **Creates a `subject_map`:** This dictionary stores all the information associated with each subject (e.g., company, person, place).  The keys of the dictionary are the subjects, and the values are dictionaries containing the predicate-object pairs.\n\n2.  **Builds Sentences Per Subject:** After processing all triples, it iterates through the `subject_map`. For each subject, it checks which predicates are present and constructs a single sentence combining all available information.\n\n3.  **More Complex Sentences:** This approach creates more complex and coherent sentences, which should lead to a higher BLEU score because it better reflects how humans would naturally express the same information.\n\nThis change aims to address the prompt's requirement for generating more complex sentences from multiple triples. It also provides a more structured way to handle the different predicates, making it easier to add more predicate-specific logic in the future."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"error_type\": \"AllTrialsFailed\", \"error_message\": \"All trials failed - common issues: timeouts, crashes, or invalid return values\", \"suggestion\": \"Check for infinite loops, ensure function returns a str\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
