Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Company. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This resulted in a series of disjointed statements. The revised code constructs a single sentence by iteratively appending clauses based on the relationships between triples. Specifically:\n\n- It initializes an empty string `sentence`.\n- For the first triple, it starts the sentence.\n- For subsequent triples, it checks if the subject matches the previous triple's subject.\n  - If it matches, it appends a comma and the new predicate-object pair, creating a compound sentence.\n  - If it doesn't match, it appends a period to end the current sentence, and then starts a new sentence with the current triple's information.\n\nThis approach aims to create more complex and coherent sentences that better reflect the relationships between the data points, thus improving the BLUE score.  The previous code was simply appending strings. This version tries to construct a single, more natural-sounding sentence.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_283\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
