This change expands the `else` block to include specific sentence structures for a wider range of predicates. This directly addresses the problem description's requirement to handle *all* possible predicates and generate more natural-sounding sentences.  By explicitly defining sentence patterns for each predicate, the generated text will be more coherent and contextually relevant, increasing the BLUE score.  It also avoids the generic \"The {predicate} of {subject} is {object_value}\" which is less fluent.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            else:\n                sentences.append(f\"The {predicate} of {subject} is {object_value}.\")\n=======\n            else:\n                if predicate == \"city\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is located in {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"netIncome\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} has a net income of {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"operatingIncome\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} has an operating income of {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"regionServed\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} serves {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"foundationPlace\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} was founded in {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"numberOfEmployees\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} employs {object_value} people.\")\n                elif predicate == \"numberOfLocations\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} has {object_value} locations.\")\n                elif predicate == \"service\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} provides {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"type\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is a {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"alternativeName\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is also known as {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"birthDate\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} was born on {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"keyPerson\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} has {object_value} as a key person.\")\n                elif predicate == \"cost\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} cost {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"location\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is located in {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"product\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} offers {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"subsidiary\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} has a subsidiary named {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"timeZone\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is in the {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is part of {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"parentCompany\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is owned by {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"revenue\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} has a revenue of {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"ethnicGroup\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} includes the {object_value} ethnic group.\")\n                elif predicate == \"governmentType\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} has a {object_value} government.\")\n                elif predicate == \"percentageOfAreaWater\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} has {object_value} of its area covered by water.\")\n                elif predicate == \"longName\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is also known as {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"populationTotal\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} has a population of {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"language\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} speaks {object_value}.\")\n                elif predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevel\":\n                    sentences.append(f\"{subject} is at an elevation of {object_value}.\")\n                else:\n                    sentences.append(f\"The {predicate} of {subject} is {object_value}.\")\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_56\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
