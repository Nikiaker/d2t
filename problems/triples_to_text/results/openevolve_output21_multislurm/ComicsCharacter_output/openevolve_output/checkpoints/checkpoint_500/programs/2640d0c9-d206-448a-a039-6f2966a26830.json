The revised code simplifies this. Critically, it checks if \"created by\" is *already* in the sentence. This prevents repeated phrases like \"and was created by...\" if multiple creators are present.\n*   **More Natural Phrasing:**  The addition of \", also created by\" makes the sentence flow more naturally when multiple creators are listed.\n*   **Full Name Consistency:** The `fullName` predicate's logic remains similar, but is also simplified for consistency with the creator predicate.\n\nThis change aims to address the issues highlighted in the provided execution outputs, where the program often generated repetitive phrases when dealing with multiple creators or related predicates.  It focuses on building more complex and grammatically correct sentences by avoiding redundancy.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        elif triple.predicate == \"creator\":\n            if subject is None or triple.subject != subject:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} was created by {triple.object}. \"\n                subject = triple.subject\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"and was created by {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"fullName\":\n            if subject is None or triple.subject != subject:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject}'s full name is {triple.object}. \"\n                subject = triple.subject\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"whose full name is {triple.object}. \"\n=======\n        elif triple.predicate == \"creator\":\n            if subject is None:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} was created by {triple.object}. \"\n                subject = triple.subject\n            else:\n                if \"created by\" not in sentence:\n                    sentence += f\" and was created by {triple.object}. \"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", also created by {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"fullName\":\n            if subject is None:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} has a full name of {triple.object}. \"\n                subject = triple.subject\n            else:\n                sentence += f\", whose full name is {triple.object}. \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_45\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
