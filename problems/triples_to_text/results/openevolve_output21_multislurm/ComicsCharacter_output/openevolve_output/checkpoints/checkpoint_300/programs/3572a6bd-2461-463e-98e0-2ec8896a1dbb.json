{"system": "You are an expert data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: ComicsCharacter. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: alternativeName - Example triple: (Airman (comicsCharacter) | alternativeName | \"Drake Stevens\")\nPredicate: creator - Example triple: (Airman (comicsCharacter) | creator | George Kapitan)\nPredicate: fullName - Example triple: (Auron (comicsCharacter) | fullName | \"Lambien\")\nPredicate: foundedBy - Example triple: (BBC | foundedBy | John Reith, 1st Baron Reith)\nPredicate: keyPerson - Example triple: (BBC | keyPerson | Rona Fairhead)\nPredicate: city - Example triple: (BBC | city | Broadcasting House)\nPredicate: product - Example triple: (BBC | product | BBC Radio)\nPredicate: lastAired - Example triple: (Bananaman | lastAired | \"1986-04-15\")\nPredicate: starring - Example triple: (Bananaman | starring | Graeme Garden)\nPredicate: firstAppearanceInFilm - Example triple: (Baymax | firstAppearanceInFilm | Big Hero 6

This allows for combining more than just the immediately following triple.\n*   **Added `firstAired` and `broadcastedBy` combination**: Added a specific condition to combine `broadcastedBy` and `firstAired` predicates which often occur together.\n*   **`i = j` Update:**  Crucially, the index `i` is updated to `j` after combining triples.  This ensures that the loop continues from the triple *after* the combined ones, preventing redundant processing.\n*   **Break Condition:** Added a `break` statement inside the `while` loop. This stops the combination process if a subsequent triple doesn't have a suitable predicate for combining, preventing nonsensical sentences.\n\nThis modification aims to create more complex and natural-sounding sentences by intelligently combining related information from multiple triples, improving the BLUE score by more accurately reflecting the semantic relationships in the data."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_6\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
