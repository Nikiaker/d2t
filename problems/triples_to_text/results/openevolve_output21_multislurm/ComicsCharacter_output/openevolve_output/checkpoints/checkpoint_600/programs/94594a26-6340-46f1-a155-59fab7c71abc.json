This works, but it can lead to slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., starting a sentence with \", and\"). Removing the `if sentence:` condition and simply appending the information creates a more natural flow, assuming the triples are processed in a logical order.  This change simplifies the logic and makes the sentence construction more consistent.
