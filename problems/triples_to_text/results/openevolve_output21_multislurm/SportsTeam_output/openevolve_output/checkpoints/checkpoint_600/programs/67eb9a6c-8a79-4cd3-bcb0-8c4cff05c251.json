Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: SportsTeam. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input.

Instead of always adding a new sentence fragment with \", where\", the code now checks if \"is in\" already exists in the sentence. If it does, it replaces it with \"is in {triple.object}, where\".  Otherwise, it appends \", and its capital is {triple.object}.\"  Similarly for currency, demonym, and language, it adds \"and its currency is...\", \"and its people are called...\", and \"and the official language is...\" respectively. This promotes more cohesive sentence structure by connecting related facts within a single sentence, which should improve the BLEU score. Using \"and\" instead of \",\" can make the sentence more readable.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_29\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
