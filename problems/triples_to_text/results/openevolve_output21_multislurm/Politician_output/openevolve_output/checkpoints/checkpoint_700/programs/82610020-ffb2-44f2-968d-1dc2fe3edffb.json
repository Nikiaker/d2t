Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Politician. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

**Improved phrasing for `country` and `capital`:** Changed \"is a country where ... is the capital\" to \"is a country with ... as its capital\" for more natural language.\n*   **Avoid redundancy for `capital`:** Added a check to see if the preceding triple was a `country` triple. If so, it avoids re-stating the capital relationship, assuming it's already implied in the context of the sentence. This avoids sentences like \"X is the capital of Y. Y is a country...\" and leads to more concise and coherent output.\n\nThis change aims to improve the fluency and coherence of the generated sentences, particularly when dealing with `country` and `capital` triples, which should translate to a better BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"error_type\": \"AllTrialsFailed\", \"error_message\": \"All trials failed - common issues: timeouts, crashes, or invalid return values\", \"suggestion\": \"Check for infinite loops, ensure function returns a str\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
