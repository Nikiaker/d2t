It also handled the `capital` separately. This improvement integrates these two predicates.  When a `country` triple is encountered, it now checks if a corresponding `capital` triple exists *for the same subject* (the country). If it does, it constructs a more complex sentence like \"is in {country}, where the capital is {capital}\". If no capital triple is found for that country, it falls back to the original \"is in {country}\" phrasing.  The `capital` predicate is made to pass to avoid repetition. This addresses the example provided in the prompt and should help improve the BLEU score by generating more natural and informative sentences when location and capital information are available. This also avoids redundant sentence construction.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        elif triple.predicate == \"country\":\n            sentence += f\"which is in {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"capital\":\n            sentence += f\", where the capital is {triple.object}. \"\n=======\n        elif triple.predicate == \"country\":\n            country = triple.object\n            if any(t.predicate == \"capital\" and t.subject == country for t in triples):\n                capital_triple = next(t for t in triples if t.predicate == \"capital\" and t.subject == country)\n                sentence += f\"is in {country}, where the capital is {capital_triple.object}. \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"is in {triple.object}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"capital\":\n            pass # Handled within the country predicate\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_120\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
