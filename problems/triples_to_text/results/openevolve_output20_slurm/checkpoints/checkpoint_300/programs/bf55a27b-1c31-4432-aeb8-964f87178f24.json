Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

\"is located in {country}\" and \"and its capital is {capital}\" as separate phrases. This doesn't create a cohesive sentence when both triples are present.  The improved code first stores the country and capital, and then attempts to find a relationship where the capital belongs to the country. If found, it replaces the existing \"is in {country}\" phrase with a more fluent sentence \"is in {country}, where the capital is {capital}\". This creates a more natural and informative sentence structure. If the country relationship is not found, it falls back to the original phrasing.
