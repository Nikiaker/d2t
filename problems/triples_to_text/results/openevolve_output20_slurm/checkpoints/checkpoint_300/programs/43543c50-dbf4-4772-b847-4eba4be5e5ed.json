This can lead to clunky sentences, especially with multiple triples. The improved version checks if a sentence already exists. If it does, it adds \"and\" before the predicate-object pair, creating a smoother flow. If it's the first predicate encountered, it directly states \"{predicate} is {object}\" to start the sentence naturally.  This addresses the issue of repetitive \"and its\" phrasing and creates more readable sentences when multiple triples are provided. Adding the isPartOf predicate condition will also help to improve the score as it was missing.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"operatingOrganisation\":\n                sentence += f\"is operated by {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"owner\":\n                sentence += f\"is owned by {triple.object}. \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\" and its {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}. \"\n=======\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"operatingOrganisation\":\n                sentence += f\"is operated by {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"owner\":\n                sentence += f\"is owned by {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                sentence += f\"which is part of {triple.object}. \"\n            else:\n                if sentence:\n                    sentence += f\" and {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}. \"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.predicate} is {triple.object}. \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_36\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
