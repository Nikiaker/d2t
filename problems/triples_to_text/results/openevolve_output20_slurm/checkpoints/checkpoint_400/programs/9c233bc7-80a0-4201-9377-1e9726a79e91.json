Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input.

separately checked for `runwayLength` and `runwaySurfaceType` and created separate sentences based on their presence.  The revised code collects all relevant runway details (length and surface type) into a list called `runway_details`. Then, it joins these details into a single string `details_string` using a comma and space.  This allows for a more concise and natural sentence structure when both details are present (e.g., \"has a runway named 10L/28R which runwayLength is 2776.0, runwaySurfaceType is Asphalt.\"). This improves the program's ability to handle multiple related facts in a single sentence, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score.  The code is also more concise and easier to read.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
