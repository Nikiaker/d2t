        "system": "You are an expert data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. The function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: cityServed - Example triple: (Aarhus_Airport | cityServed | \"Aarhus, Denmark\")\nPredicate: elevationAboveTheSeaLevel -

Specifically, we can use a dictionary to map the predicate to a sentence template, which will allow us to handle different predicates in a more structured and flexible way.\n\nHere's the suggested improvement:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef predict(triples: list[Triple]) -> str:\n    return f\"The {triples[0].predicate} of {triples[0].subject} is {triples[0].object}.\"\n=======\ndef predict(triples: list[Triple]) -> str:\n    predicate_templates = {\n        \"cityServed\": \"serves the city of {}\",\n        \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevel\": \"has an elevation of {} meters above sea level\",\n        \"location\": \"is located in {}\",\n        # Add more templates as needed\n    }\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store the sentence templates for each predicate\n    sentence_templates = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over the triples to populate the sentence templates\n    for triple in triples:\n        if triple.predicate in predicate_templates:\n            # If the predicate has a template, use it to create a sentence\n            sentence_template = predicate_templates[triple.predicate]\n            sentence = sentence_template.format(triple.object)\n            # Store the sentence template in the dictionary\n            sentence_templates[triple.subject] = sentence\n    \n    # Generate the final sentence by joining the sentence templates for each subject\n    final_sentence = \"\"\n    for subject, sentence in sentence_templates.items():\n        final_sentence += sentence + \" \"\n    \n    return final_sentence.strip()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis improvement introduces a dictionary `predicate_templates` that maps each predicate to a sentence template. The `predict` function then uses this dictionary to create sentence templates for each triple, and stores them in a new dictionary `sentence_templates`. Finally, it generates the final sentence by joining the sentence templates for each subject.\n\nThis approach allows for more flexibility and structure in handling different predicates, which could improve the program's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant sentences.",

The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. The function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input.

The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. The function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: cityServed - Example triple: (Aarhus_Airport | cityServed | \"Aarhus, Denmark\")\nPredicate: elevationAboveTheSeaLevel -

Example triple: (Abilene_Regional_Airport | 1stRunwaySurfaceType | Asphalt)\nPredicate: 3rdRunwayLengthFeet - Example triple: (Abilene_Regional_Airport | 3rdRunwayLengthFeet | 7202)\nPredicate: icaoLocationIdentifier - Example triple: (Abilene_Regional_Airport | icaoLocationIdentifier | \"KABI\")\nPredicate: locationIdentifier - Example triple: (Abilene_Regional_Airport | locationIdentifier | \"ABI\")\nPredicate: elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet - Example triple: (Afonso_Pena_International_Airport | elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet | 2988)\nPredicate: iataLocationIdentifier - Example triple: (Agra_Airport | iataLocationIdentifier | \"AGR\")\nPredicate: nativeName -

The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. The function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input.
