Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples.

The `predict` function then uses this dictionary to create sentence templates for each triple, and stores them in a new dictionary `sentence_templates`. Finally, it generates the final sentence by joining the sentence templates for each subject.\n\nThis approach allows for more flexibility and structure in handling different predicates, which could improve the program's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.
