{"diff_user": {"system": "You are an expert data engineer specializing in converting data to text. You will be given the current Python program with its scores and an inspiration program and your task will be to evolve the current Python program to improve the scores. It is a program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program must implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. There is also a dedicated score for sentence count called avg_sentences_length_score, where 1.0 is a perfect sentence count and 0.0 is the worst sentence count. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist - Example triple: (Aaron Bertram | associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist | Kids Imagine Nation)\nPredicate: background - Example triple: (Aaron Bertram | background | \"non vocal instrumentalist\")\nPredicate: birthDate - Example triple: (Aaron Bertram | birthDate | 1981-04-03)\nPredicate: genre - Example triple: (Aaron Bertram | genre | Ska punk)\nPredicate: instrument - Example triple: (Aaron Deer | instrument | Bass guitar)\nPredicate: origin - Example triple: (Aaron Deer | origin | Indiana)\nPredicate: activeYearsStartYear - Example triple: (Aaron Turner | activeYearsStartYear | 1995)\nPredicate: birthPlace - Example triple: (Abradab | birthPlace | Katowice)\nPredicate: birthYear - Example triple: (Ace Wilder | birthYear | 1982)\nPredicate: occupation - Example triple: (Ace Wilder | occupation | Singing)\nPredicate: recordLabel - Example triple: (Ace Wilder | recordLabel | Warner Music Group)\nPredicate: deathPlace - Example triple: (Agust\u00edn Barboza | deathPlace | Asunci\u00f3n)\nPredicate: alternativeName - Example triple: (Ahmet Ertegun | alternativeName | \"A.

**Conciseness:** It uses f-strings to construct the sentence, which helps reduce redundancy and makes the code more concise.\n* **Style:** It replaces the generic \"triple.subject\" and \"triple.object\" with more descriptive variable names, making the code more consistent and readable.\n* **Improved Sentence Generation:** It replaces the generic \"triple.subject\" and \"triple.object\" with the extracted subject and object values, leading to more accurate and informative sentences.\n\nThis change can potentially lead to a slight improvement in the combined_score by
