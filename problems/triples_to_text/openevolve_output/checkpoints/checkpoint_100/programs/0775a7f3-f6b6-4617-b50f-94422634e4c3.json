Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

predicates, and it constructed a sentence incrementally, which limited its ability to combine information effectively. The improved code collects all the facts into a list `facts` and then joins them with commas and a period at the end. This approach allows for a more comprehensive sentence that includes all available information, improving the chances of a higher BLEU score. It also handles a larger number of predicates more cleanly without adding more `if/elif` blocks.  It avoids the initial assumptions about airport, city and country. This creates a more general approach."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_5\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
