Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

disjointed phrases when multiple triples are present.  The change introduces conjunctions (\"which is in\", \"where the capital is\", \"with...\") and commas to connect related facts more smoothly. This addresses the examples given in the problem description where multiple triples are combined into a single, coherent sentence.  Specifically, this change will help with the example:\n\n`(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)`\n`(Belgium | country | Antwerp)`\n`(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)`\n\nwhich should result in:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe added commas and conjunctions will help generate a more fluent and natural-sounding sentence.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_100\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
