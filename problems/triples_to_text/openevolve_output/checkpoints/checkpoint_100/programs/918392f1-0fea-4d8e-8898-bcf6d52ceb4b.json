Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This change uses a list `sentence` to accumulate sentence fragments.\n\n1.  **List Accumulation:** Instead of directly concatenating to a string, each relevant piece of information is appended as a separate sentence fragment to the `sentence` list.\n2.  **`insert(0, ...)`:**  The core relationship (e.g., \"Airport serves city\") is inserted at the *beginning* of the list. This ensures that the most important contextual information appears first.\n3.  **`join()`:** Finally, the `join()` method combines the list elements into a single string with spaces between them.\n\nThis approach allows for a more structured sentence construction and improves the chances of generating a coherent and grammatically correct sentence, especially when multiple triples are provided.  It's also more flexible for adding more sophisticated sentence planning logic in the future.  Using a list is more efficient for building strings in a loop than repeated string concatenation."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_588\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
