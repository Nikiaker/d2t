Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

Instead, the code iterates through all triples and directly constructs sentences based on each triple's predicate and object. This makes the code more general and able to handle a wider range of predicates without needing specific conditional logic for each one.  It also simplifies the sentence construction process and avoids the potentially awkward insertion of a combined sentence at the beginning, allowing for a more natural flow of information derived directly from the triples.  The formatting of the sentences is also improved for better readability. This change should allow the program to generate more comprehensive and contextually relevant sentences from the input triples, thus improving the BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_57\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
