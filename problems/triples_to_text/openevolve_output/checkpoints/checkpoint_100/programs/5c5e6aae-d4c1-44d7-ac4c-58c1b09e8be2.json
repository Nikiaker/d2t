Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

now loops through each triple in the input list.\n*   **Conditional Sentence Building:**  It uses `if/elif` statements to handle different predicates and construct the sentence accordingly. This ensures that the generated text is contextually relevant to the specific predicate.\n*   **Handles Multiple Triples:** The code builds a single sentence by appending phrases based on each triple.\n*   **Subject Handling:**  The code initializes the subject from the first triple and uses it as a reference for subsequent triples.\n*   **Default case:** Added a default case to handle any unexpected predicates.\n*   **Ending punctuation:** Added a period to the end of the sentence.\n\nThis improved version addresses the prompt's requirements by generating more complex and coherent sentences from multiple triples.  It provides a basic framework for handling the different predicates and can be extended with more sophisticated logic to improve the fluency and accuracy of the generated text."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_25\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
