Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe original code had a lot of `if/elif` blocks to handle each predicate. This made it difficult to extend and resulted in disjointed sentences.  The revised code accumulates all facts into a list called `facts`.  Then, it joins these facts with commas and a period to create a single, more complex sentence. This approach can handle an arbitrary number of triples and predicates, creating a more informative and coherent output. It also removes the hardcoded logic for airport/city/country combinations, making it more generic."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_376\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
