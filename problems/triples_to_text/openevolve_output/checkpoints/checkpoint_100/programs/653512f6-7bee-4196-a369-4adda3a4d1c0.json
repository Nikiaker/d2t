Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

concatenating strings, which can lead to less fluent and grammatically correct sentences, especially when dealing with multiple triples. The revised code uses a list to store sentence fragments, and then joins them at the end. This allows for more flexible sentence construction and easier insertion of clauses at the beginning based on the presence of key information (airport, city, country).  This approach is more aligned with the example sentences provided in the problem description, which demonstrate complex sentences constructed from multiple pieces of information.  Using a list avoids the potential for awkward phrasing caused by repeated string concatenation. Also, the original code had redundant string concatenation using `+=` which is replaced with `append` for better readability and efficiency.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_50\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
