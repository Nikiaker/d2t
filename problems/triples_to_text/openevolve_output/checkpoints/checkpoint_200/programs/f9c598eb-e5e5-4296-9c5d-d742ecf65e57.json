engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

series of `if/elif` statements are used to handle each possible predicate. This allows for constructing more natural and contextually appropriate sentences based on the relationship expressed in the triple.  Each predicate generates a specific phrase.\n*   **Subject Handling:** The code initializes the subject with the first triple's subject, and then uses it in subsequent sentences to create a more coherent narrative.\n*   **Default Case:**  A final `else` statement handles any unknown predicates gracefully.\n*   **Strip whitespace**: Removes leading/trailing whitespace for"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_97\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
