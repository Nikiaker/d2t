Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

the change:**\n\nThe original `else` block simply appended information without attempting to connect it to the existing sentence structure.  The modification introduces conjunctions (\"which\", \"where\", \"and\") to better integrate the new information into the sentence. This creates a more fluid and natural-sounding sentence, rather than a series of disconnected facts.  Specifically, changing the phrasing for \"isPartOf\", \"language\", and \"operatingOrganisation\" to use relative clauses or conjunctions will likely lead to a higher BLEU score by more closely matching the reference sentences.  The \"and has a...\" phrasing is kept for other predicates as it seems more appropriate in those cases."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_148\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
