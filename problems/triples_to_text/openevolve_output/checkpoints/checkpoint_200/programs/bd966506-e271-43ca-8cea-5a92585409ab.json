Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

triples separately.  This change introduces `country` and `capital` variables to store the values when encountered.  Crucially, when a \"capital\" triple is processed *after* a \"country\" triple, it constructs a more natural sentence linking the two: \"The capital of [country] is [capital]\". This improves the coherence and context of the generated text, especially when country and capital information are present in the same input.  This addresses the example given in the prompt and should lead to a higher BLUE score by better capturing the relationships between entities. It also handles cases where the capital is mentioned without the country."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_171\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
