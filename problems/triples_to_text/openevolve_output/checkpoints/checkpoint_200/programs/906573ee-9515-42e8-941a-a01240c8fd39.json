This change adds more specific phrasing for predicates like `isPartOf`, `language`, `operatingOrganisation`, `owner`, `leaderParty`, and `largestCity`, leading to more natural-sounding sentences. Using \"and\" before adding more information helps create a more fluent sentence structure when multiple triples are processed. The comma after `isPartOf` allows for smoother continuation of the sentence. This should improve the coherence and readability of the generated text, increasing the BLUE score.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                sentence += f\"is part of {triple.object} which \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"language\":\n                sentence += f\"speaks {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"operatingOrganisation\":\n                sentence += f\"is operated by {triple.object}. \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"has a {triple.predicate} of {triple.object}. \"\n=======\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                sentence += f\"is part of {triple.object}, \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"language\":\n                sentence += f\"and its official language is {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"operatingOrganisation\":\n                sentence += f\"and is operated by {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"owner\":\n                sentence += f\"and is owned by {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"leaderParty\":\n                sentence += f\"and is led by the {triple.object}. \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"largestCity\":\n                sentence += f\"with {triple.object} as its largest city. \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"and has a {triple.predicate} of {triple.object}. \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_95\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
