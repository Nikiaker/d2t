Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code constructs a list of details and joins them.  However, it doesn't always create the most natural-sounding sentence. The improved version adds direct sentence appends *after* the initial runway description if `runway_length` and `runway_surface` are both available. This creates a more fluent sentence structure like \"Airport X's runway Y is Z meters long and has a surface of W\".  This approach can improve the sentence's readability and coherence, which should positively impact the BLEU score.  The additional conditional statements ensure that even if only one of length or surface is available, a meaningful sentence fragment is added."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
