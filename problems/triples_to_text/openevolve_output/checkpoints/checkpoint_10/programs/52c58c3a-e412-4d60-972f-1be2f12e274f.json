Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The general topic is Airports. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: cityServed - Example triple: (Aarhus Airport | cityServed | \"Aarhus, Denmark\")\nPredicate: elevationAboveTheSeaLevel -
