This results in a list-like sentence structure (\"Subject, information. and Subject2, information.\"). The proposed change aims to improve fluency by:\n\n1.  **Checking for Subject Repetition:** If the current triple's subject is the same as the previous one, it only adds \"and\" before the subject, avoiding redundancy.\n2.  **Combining Information:** By keeping the same subject active, it enables the creation of more complex sentences that describe multiple attributes of the same entity. This addresses the prompt's emphasis on handling multiple triples effectively.\n\nThis change should help the program generate more coherent and natural-sounding sentences, potentially improving the BLEU score.
