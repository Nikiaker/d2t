Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: SportsTeam. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

change:**\n\nThe original code attempted to intelligently combine sentences based on the subject, but the `replace` method was prone to errors and could lead to awkward phrasing.  The revised code simplifies this process by joining all sentences with a comma and \"and\" before the last sentence. This approach is more robust and generally produces more readable and grammatically correct combined sentences, especially when dealing with varied triple types. It also avoids the potential errors of the string manipulation in the original code.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_52\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
