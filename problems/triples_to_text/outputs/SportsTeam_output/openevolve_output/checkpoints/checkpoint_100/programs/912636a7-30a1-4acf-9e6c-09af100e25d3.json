Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: SportsTeam. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

triples. The improved code collects individual clauses in a list called `clauses`. Then, it checks the length of the list:\n\n- If there's only one clause, it simply returns that clause with a period.\n- If there are multiple clauses, it joins all but the last clause with commas and then adds \", and\" before the last clause for more natural flow. This creates a more readable and grammatically correct sentence.  This addresses the core issue of poor sentence structure observed in the previous outputs. Using a list and joining makes the code cleaner and more adaptable for more complex sentence building in the future."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_19\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
