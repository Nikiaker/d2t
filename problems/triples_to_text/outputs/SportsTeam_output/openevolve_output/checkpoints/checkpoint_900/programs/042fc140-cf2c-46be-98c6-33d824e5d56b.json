It tends to generate repetitive or awkward phrasing. A key area for improvement is how it handles conjunctions (\"and\", \",\") and the overall sentence structure when combining multiple facts. The current logic for adding commas is simplistic and doesn't account for the length or complexity of the clauses being joined.\n\nHere's a proposed improvement to enhance sentence structure and flow, specifically focusing on better conjunction usage:\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if len(sentence.split(\".\")) > 1:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            elif len(sentence.split(\" and \")) > 1:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            else:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n        else:\n            if len(sentence.split(\".\")) > 1:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            elif len(sentence.split(\" and \")) > 0:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n            else:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n```\nRationale:\n\nThe original code checks if the sentence already contains a period or \" and \". If it finds a period it adds a comma. If it finds \"and\" it adds a comma. This is incorrect. If \"and\" is already present, we should continue to add \"and\" to separate further clauses. The current logic results in sentences like \"X and, Y and Z\" which is grammatically incorrect. The corrected code ensures that \"and\" is only added when it's not already present, leading to more natural sentence construction. This small change should improve the flow and readability of the generated sentences, potentially boosting the BLEU score.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if len(sentence.split(\".\")) > 1:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            elif len(sentence.split(\" and \")) > 1:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            else:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n=======\n        else:\n            if len(sentence.split(\".\")) > 1:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            elif len(sentence.split(\" and \")) > 0:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n            else:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_2\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
