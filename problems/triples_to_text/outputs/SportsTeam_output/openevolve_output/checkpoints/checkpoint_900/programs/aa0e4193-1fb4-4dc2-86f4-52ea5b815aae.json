The logic for adding conjunctions (\"and\", \",\") is too simplistic and doesn't account for sentence length or the relationships between triples. A more sophisticated approach is needed to create smoother, more natural-sounding sentences. Specifically, the handling of multiple predicates related to the same subject needs improvement.\n\nHere's a suggested improvement focusing on more intelligent conjunction usage and better handling of multiple triples:\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if len(sentence.split(\",\")) > 0:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            elif len(sentence.split(\" \")) > 8:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n            else:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n        else:\n            if len(sentence.split(\",\")) > 0:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            elif len(sentence.split(\" \")) > 12:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n            else:\n                sentence += \", \"\n```\nRationale:\n\nThe original code adds \"and\" when the sentence is longer than 8 words. This is too aggressive and leads to awkward phrasing. Increasing the word limit to 12 before adding \"and\" allows for longer, more descriptive phrases before introducing a conjunction.  I've also changed the default to \", \" instead of \"and\" to encourage a more natural flow of information, especially when multiple facts about the same subject are being presented. This will make the sentences more readable and hopefully improve the BLEU score by aligning closer to the example correct sentences.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if len(sentence.split(\",\")) > 0:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            elif len(sentence.split(\" \")) > 8:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n            else:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n=======\n        else:\n            if len(sentence.split(\",\")) > 0:\n                sentence += \", \"\n            elif len(sentence.split(\" \")) > 12:\n                sentence += \" and \"\n            else:\n                sentence += \", \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_68\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
