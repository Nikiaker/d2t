This restricts the program's ability to create more complex relative clauses when dealing with other relationships like \"isPartOf\" or \"part\".  Adding \"isPartOf\" and \"part\" to this condition allows the program to generate sentences like \"\u2026city which is a part of \u2026\", which is a more natural way to combine these triples. This addresses the example cases where the program failed to connect related concepts effectively.
