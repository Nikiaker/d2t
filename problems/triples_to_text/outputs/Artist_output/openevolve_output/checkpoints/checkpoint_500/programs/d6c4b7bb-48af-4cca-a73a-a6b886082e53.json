Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist.

repetitive.  Using phrases like \"which is known for\" or \"its capital being\" creates a smoother flow.\n*   **Vocabulary Variation:** Replaced \"people are called\" with \"inhabitants are called\" or \"people are known as\" to avoid repetition and enhance readability.\n*   **\"residing in\" for ethnicGroup:** Changed \"in\" to \"residing in\" for the ethnicGroup predicate to sound more formal and natural.\n\nThese changes aim to improve the overall quality of the generated sentences, making them more coherent and less robotic, which should contribute to a higher BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_244\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
