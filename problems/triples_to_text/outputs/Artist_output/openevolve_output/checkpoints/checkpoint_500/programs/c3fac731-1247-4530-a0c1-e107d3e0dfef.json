Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

also searching for and incorporating information about the country's demonym and currency.  Instead of separate `if/elif` blocks, it gathers relevant details into a list (`details`) and then constructs a single, more comprehensive sentence using `', '.join(details)`. This results in potentially longer and more informative sentences when multiple facts about the country are available, increasing the likelihood of a higher BLUE score by capturing more of the input data in a fluent manner.  The phrasing \"it is known for\" is used to connect the details about the country in a natural way.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_54\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
