Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This led to potentially fragmented sentences.\n\nThe improved code builds a base sentence `description` and then creates a `details` list to hold any available country details. Finally, it joins the `details` with commas and appends them to the base sentence, resulting in a more fluent and comprehensive description.
