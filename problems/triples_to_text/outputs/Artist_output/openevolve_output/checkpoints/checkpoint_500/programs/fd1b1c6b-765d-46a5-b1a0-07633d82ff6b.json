Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

More importantly, it didn't efficiently combine multiple facts about a country into a single, flowing sentence. The revised code creates a list `country_details` to store available information (capital, language, demonym).  Then, it uses `', '.join(country_details)` to build a more natural phrase (\"which is known for its capital, the official language, and people called...\") if multiple details are available. This produces more complex and coherent sentences, potentially improving the BLUE score by better reflecting the relationships between triples.
