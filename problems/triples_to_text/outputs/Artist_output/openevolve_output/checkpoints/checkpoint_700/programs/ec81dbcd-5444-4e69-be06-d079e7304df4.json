are an expert data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

change:**\n\nThe original code built a `parts` list and then joined it.  The revised code builds `country_info` and uses a slightly different phrasing (\"which has...\", \"where...\", \"and its people...\") to make the resulting sentence flow more naturally. This subtle change in wording aims to improve the coherence and readability of sentences when multiple facts about a country are present, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score by more closely matching human-written reference sentences. It also removes unnecessary repetition of \"its\" in the sentence.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_126\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
