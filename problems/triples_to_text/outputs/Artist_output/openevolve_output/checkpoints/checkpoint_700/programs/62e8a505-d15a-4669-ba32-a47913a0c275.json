Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence.

REPLACE\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe original code had a long chain of `if/elif` statements for the `country` predicate, making the code verbose and less readable.  More importantly, it didn't attempt to combine all available information into a single, more fluent sentence when multiple pieces of information (capital, language, demonym) were available.\n\nThe improved code simplifies this by creating a `description` list and appending relevant information to it. Then, it joins the elements of the list with commas to create a more natural-sounding sentence. This approach allows for a more concise and readable way to handle multiple facts related to a country.  I've also made a minor change to the ethnic group predicate to add \"The\" for better grammar.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_390\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
