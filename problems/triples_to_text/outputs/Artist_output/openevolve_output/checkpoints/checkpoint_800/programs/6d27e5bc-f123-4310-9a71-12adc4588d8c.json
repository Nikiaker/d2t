data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

The improved version adds \"demonym\" (the name for people from that country) to the description. This allows for more complete and natural-sounding sentences when all three relationships are present in the input triples.  For example, instead of just saying \"{subject} is in {object_}, which has {capital} as its capital,\" it can now say \"{subject} is in {object_}, which has {capital} as its capital, where {language} is spoken, and its people are called {demonym}.\" This increased complexity and contextual awareness should improve the BLEU score by producing sentences closer to the example correct sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_45\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
