Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

\"Its currency is {t.object}.\" to \"Its currency is the {t.object}.\" for more natural phrasing.\n2.  **Combined Capital Search and Override:** The code now searches for the capital within the loop, ensuring the most recently found capital is used, in case it's specified multiple times.\n3.  **Simplified Sentence Structure:** The sentence structure is streamlined to improve readability.  Instead of potentially redundant phrasing, it aims for a more concise and natural flow.  The `It` is added before the joined related info for smoother reading.\n4.  **Removed Redundant `if related_info` check:** The check is not needed as `\"\".join(related_info)` will result in an empty string if `related_info` is empty, which will not affect the sentence.\n\nThis change aims to create more fluent and informative sentences when multiple facts about a country are present in the triples.
