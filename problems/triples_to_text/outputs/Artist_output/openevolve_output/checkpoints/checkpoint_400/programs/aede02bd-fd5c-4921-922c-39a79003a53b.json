Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence.

The suggested change refines the wording to be more natural (\"is located in\" instead of \"is in\", \"with\" instead of \"which has\", \"official language\" to be more precise).  More importantly, it slightly alters the sentence structure to flow more smoothly and read better. The change from \"has {country_capital} as its capital\" to \"with {country_capital} as its capital\" is a subtle but meaningful improvement in readability.  The addition of \"official\" before language clarifies the intent and makes the sentence more grammatically correct.
