Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

statements to handle different combinations of country-related information (capital, language, demonym). This is verbose and can lead to repetitive sentence structures.\n\nThe improved code creates a list called `description` to store relevant phrases.  It then appends phrases to this list based on the available information. Finally, it joins the phrases with commas and creates a single, more concise sentence.  This approach makes the code cleaner and allows for more flexible and natural-sounding sentences when multiple country attributes are present.
