engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

Replacing \"is in\" with \"is located in\" provides a slight but noticeable improvement in fluency. Additionally, changing \"whose capital is\" to \"which has {capital} as its capital\" and similar adjustments to other clauses, makes the sentences flow more naturally, especially when multiple attributes of the country are being combined into a single sentence.
