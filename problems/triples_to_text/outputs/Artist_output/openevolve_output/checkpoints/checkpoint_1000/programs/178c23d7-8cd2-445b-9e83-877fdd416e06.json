language) but doesn't attempt to connect these attributes to *other* triples in the input.  The modified code adds a loop that iterates through *all* triples again.  Within this loop, it checks if any of the triples relate to the `capital` or `language` found earlier. If it finds a related triple (e.g., a triple stating the country *of* the capital), it appends that information to the sentence.\n\n**Why this improves the BLUE score:**\n\n*   **Increased Contextual Connection:** By linking related entities (e.g., \"London is in England\"), the generated sentences become more coherent and informative, more closely resembling the example sentences.\n*   **Handles More Complex Scenarios:** This change allows the program to handle cases where multiple triples describe relationships between the same entities, creating longer, more complex sentences.\n*   **Better Sentence Structure:** The addition of connecting phrases (\"which has...\", \"where...\") improves the flow and readability of the generated text.\n\nThis is a targeted improvement that addresses a key weakness of the original program\u2014its inability to leverage relationships between multiple triples to create more comprehensive and natural-sounding sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_89\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
