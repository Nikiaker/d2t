The improved code adds a check *after* adding the country details to see if there are triples that describe the country of the capital city.

For example, if the triples included `(London | country | United Kingdom)` and `(United Kingdom | capital | London)`, the improved code would generate a sentence like \"London is in United Kingdom, its capital is London. London is in United Kingdom.\" which is a more coherent sentence structure.
