data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Artist. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence.

This resulted in slightly different sentence structures depending on which information was available.\n\nThe improved code consolidates this logic by creating a single `description` list. It appends phrases about the capital, currency, and language to this list if they are found in the triples. Then, it joins these phrases with commas and uses a single `sentence +=` statement to create a more unified sentence structure:  `\"{subject} is in {object_}, which {', '.join(description)}. \"`\n\nThis change encourages the program to combine related information into a single sentence whenever possible, which should lead to more fluent and coherent output, and thus a higher BLEU score. It addresses the issue of generating multiple short, disconnected sentences when richer information is available.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_245\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
