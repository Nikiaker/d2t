This allows for a more cohesive description of the country.\n*   **Improved Sentence Structure:** The `country_description` is joined with commas and incorporated into a single sentence fragment, making the overall sentence flow better.  Using \"with... as its capital\" and \"whose people are called...\" sounds more natural.\n*   **Maintained Existing Functionality:** The code still handles cases where some of the country-related information is missing gracefully.\n*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is reorganized to improve readability and maintainability.\n\nThis change is expected to improve the BLEU score by generating more natural and human-like sentences, especially when dealing with triples that describe countries and their attributes.  It focuses on creating a more coherent and grammatically correct structure for sentences that combine multiple pieces of information.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            country = object_val\n            capital_info = next((t for t in triples if t.subject == country and t.predicate == \"capital\"), None)\n            demonym_info = next((t for t in triples if t.subject == country and t.predicate == \"demonym\"), None)\n            leader_info = next((t for t in triples if t.subject == country and t.predicate == \"leader\"), None)\n\n            sentence_parts = []\n            if capital_info:\n                sentence_parts.append(f\"whose capital is {capital_info.object}\")\n            if demonym_info:\n                sentence_parts.append(f\"and its people are known as {demonym_info.object}\")\n            if leader_info:\n                sentence_parts.append(f\"and is currently led by {leader_info.object}\")\n\n            if sentence_parts:\n                sentence += f\"{subject} is located in {country}, \" + \", \".join(sentence_parts) + \". \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"{subject} is located in {country}. \"\n        elif predicate == \"foundationPlace\":\n            sentence += f\"{subject} was founded in {object_val}. \"\n=======\n            country = object_val\n            capital_info = next((t for t in triples if t.subject == country and t.predicate == \"capital\"), None)\n            demonym_info = next((t for t in triples if t.subject == country and t.predicate == \"demonym\"), None)\n            leader_info = next((t for t in triples if t.subject == country and t.predicate == \"leader\"), None)\n\n            country_description = []\n            if capital_info:\n                country_description.append(f\"with {capital_info.object} as its capital\")\n            if demonym_info:\n                country_description.append(f\"whose people are called {demonym_info.object}\")\n            if leader_info:\n                country_description.append(f\"and led by {leader_info.object}\")\n\n            if country_description:\n                sentence += f\"{subject} is located in {country}, {', '.join(country_description)}. \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"{subject} is located in {country}. \"\n        elif predicate == \"foundationPlace\":\n            sentence += f\"{subject} was founded in {object_val}. \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_54\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
