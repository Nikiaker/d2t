changes aim for more natural English phrasing.\n*   **More descriptive sentence structure:** Added \"is a country located in\" to provide more context when the predicate is \"country.\"\n*   **Consistent sentence flow:** The revised phrasing promotes a smoother flow when multiple related facts (capital, demonym, leader) are included in the same sentence.\n*   **Focus on sentence complexity:** The goal is to generate more complex sentences that capture more information from the triples in a coherent way, which should improve the BLUE score by better matching reference
