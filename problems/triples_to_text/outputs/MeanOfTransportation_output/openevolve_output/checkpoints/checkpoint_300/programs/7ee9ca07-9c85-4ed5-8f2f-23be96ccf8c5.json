Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

It only checked for the *presence* of \"location\" in the next sentence but didn't extract the actual location information to create a more natural sentence.  The change extracts the location from the subsequent sentence when both sentences involve location predicates, leading to better phrasing.  I also adjusted the capital/country logic to be more robust when the 'is located in' phrase is not present in the second sentence.
