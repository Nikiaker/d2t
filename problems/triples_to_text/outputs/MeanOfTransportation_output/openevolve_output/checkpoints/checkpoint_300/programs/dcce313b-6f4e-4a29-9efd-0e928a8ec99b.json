Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

It also relatedMeanOfTransportation Plymouth Plaza. It also manufacturer Dodge. \nThe example correct sentences are:\nThe 1955 Dodge is manufactured by Dodge and related to the Plymouth Plaza and the DeSoto Custom.\nDodge is the manufacturer of the 1955 Dodge which is a related means of transportation to the DeSoto Custom and the Plymouth Plaza.\nThe 1955 Dodge and the DeSoto Custom and Plymouth Plaza are related vehicles. The 1955 Dodge is made by Dodge.\n\n```\n\n# Program Evolution History\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions
