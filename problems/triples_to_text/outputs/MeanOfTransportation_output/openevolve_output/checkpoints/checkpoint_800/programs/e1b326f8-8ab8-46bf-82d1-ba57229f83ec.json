Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

The improved code:\n\n1.  **Explicitly assigns `object_val` to `country`:** This makes the code more readable.\n2.  **Collects information into a list:** Instead of multiple `if/elif` statements, it creates a `sentence_parts` list to hold the relevant phrases (capital, demonym, leader).\n3.  **Joins the phrases:**  It then uses `\", \".join(sentence_parts)` to create a more fluent and combined sentence if any of the information is available.\n4. **Includes leader information:** Added the leader information to the sentence.\n\nThis change aims to create more complex and informative sentences when information about a country is present, leading to a potentially higher BLEU score because the generated sentences will be closer to the reference sentences that combine these details.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_219\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
