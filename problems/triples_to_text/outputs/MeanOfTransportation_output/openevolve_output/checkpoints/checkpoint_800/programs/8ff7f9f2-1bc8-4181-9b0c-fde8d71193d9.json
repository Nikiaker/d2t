Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This approach is fine, but it can lead to slightly awkward phrasing. The revised code directly builds a string `country_details` that is more natural sounding. The phrase structure \"its capital is...\", \"its people are called...\" flows better than \"with ... as its capital\", \"whose people are known as...\". This change aims to produce more fluent and grammatically correct sentences, particularly when multiple pieces of information about a country are present, which should lead to a higher BLEU score.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_65\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
