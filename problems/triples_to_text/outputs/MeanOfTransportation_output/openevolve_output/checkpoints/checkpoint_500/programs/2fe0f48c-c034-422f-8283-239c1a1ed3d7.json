engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

Instead of simply stating the country, it now checks if there's another triple in the list where the country is the subject and \"capital\" is the predicate. If found, it incorporates the capital city into the sentence, creating a more complex and informative statement.  This attempts to link related pieces of information within the triples, leading to more natural-sounding sentences.  I also improved wording of other predicates to make the sentence more natural.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_192\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
