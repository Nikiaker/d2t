For example, instead of just saying \"relatedMeanOfTransportation DeSoto Custom\", it will say \"1955 Dodge relatedMeanOfTransportation is DeSoto Custom.\" This is a small change, but it can significantly improve the overall fluency and coherence of the generated text, leading to a higher BLEU score.
