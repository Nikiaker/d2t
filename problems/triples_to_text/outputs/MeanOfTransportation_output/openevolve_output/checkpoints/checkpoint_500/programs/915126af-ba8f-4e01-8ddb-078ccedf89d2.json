Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

`demonym`, and `leader` predicates.  The code now checks if related triples exist (e.g., a \"country\" triple when processing a \"capital\" triple). If a related triple is found, it attempts to construct a more complex sentence that incorporates information from both triples, resulting in a more coherent and natural-sounding output.  This addresses the problem of generating short, disconnected sentences.  The `next()` function with a generator expression efficiently finds the related triple if it exists. If the related triple does not exist, the original sentence structure is retained, ensuring no information is lost."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_134\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
