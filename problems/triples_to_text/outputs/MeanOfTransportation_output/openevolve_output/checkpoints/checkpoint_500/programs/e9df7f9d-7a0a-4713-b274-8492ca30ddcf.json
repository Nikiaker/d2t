are an expert data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

The modified code now attempts to find related triples for \"capital\" and \"demonym\" within the provided list. If found, it incorporates this information into a more complex and informative sentence, creating a more natural flow and connection between related facts.  This addresses the issue of the program generating very simple, disconnected sentences. This improvement is focused on the \"country\" predicate as it commonly has associated \"capital\" and \"demonym\" triples.  This approach can be extended to other predicates as well.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_63\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
