Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

Change:**\n\nThe original code had a special case for the \"country\" predicate, adding \"which is in\". While potentially useful, it disrupts the flow when other predicates are present.  The change removes this specific handling and adopts a more consistent approach:\n\n*   **For the last triple:** It continues to use \"and its {predicate} is {object\\_value}.\" to indicate the final piece of information.\n*   **For all other triples:** It uses a simpler \"and {predicate} is {object\\_value}.\" This creates a smoother chain of clauses, making the sentence more readable and less repetitive.  Removing the \"also has a\" phrase reduces redundancy.\n\nThis change should lead to a more natural-sounding sentence structure, potentially improving the BLEU score by aligning the generated text more closely with the example sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_60\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
