Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: MeanOfTransportation. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

Specifically, it checks if the sentence contains \"is located in\" before attempting to split it. If it does, it uses the part after \"is located in\" to avoid errors and create a more natural flow.  This addresses cases where the sentence structure isn't exactly as anticipated. It also changed the \", where\" to \"which is located in\" to make the sentence more natural.\n\nThis change aims to make the sentence construction more robust and contextually appropriate, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score by producing more human-like output."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_142\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
