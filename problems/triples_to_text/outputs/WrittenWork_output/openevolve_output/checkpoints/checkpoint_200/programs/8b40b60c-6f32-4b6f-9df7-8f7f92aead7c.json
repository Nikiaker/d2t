The improved version iterates through all the triples, and based on the `predicate`, appends a relevant sentence fragment to a `sentence` string.  This allows the function to handle multiple triples and create a more complex and informative sentence.  The `strip()` method is used at the end to remove any trailing whitespace.  The added if statements handle each predicate type and generate the corresponding sentence fragment. This approach is more flexible and can generate sentences that capture more information from the given triples. An empty string is returned if the input list is empty.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_37\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
