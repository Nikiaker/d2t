Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

Instead of joining the `property_strings` with just a comma, I've added a conditional statement to append a comma *after* each property string *except* the last one.  This ensures that the last property is not followed by a comma, resulting in a more grammatically correct and natural-sounding sentence.  This addresses a common issue in the original code where it would produce sentences like \"Subject is property1, property2, , property3.\".  The use of `i < len(properties) - 1` efficiently checks if the current property is the last one in the list."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_50\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
