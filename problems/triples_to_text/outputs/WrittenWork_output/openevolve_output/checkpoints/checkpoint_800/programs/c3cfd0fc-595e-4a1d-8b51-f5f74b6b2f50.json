Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This change extends the \"country\" predicate handling to *also* look for a \"language\" triple where the subject is the same country. If both a capital and language triple are found for the same country, the sentence is constructed to include both pieces of information in a single, more complex clause.  This addresses cases where the triples describe related properties of the same entity (e.g., a country's capital and language).  If only one of the capital or language triple is found, it is handled accordingly.
