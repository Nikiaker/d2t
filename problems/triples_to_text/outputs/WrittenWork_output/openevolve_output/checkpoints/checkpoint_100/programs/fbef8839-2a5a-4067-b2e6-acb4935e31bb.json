Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

generated a separate sentence for each triple related to location/affiliation/education.  This change introduces variables to store the object values for predicates like \"country,\" \"almaMater,\" etc.  It then combines these into a single, potentially longer sentence *after* processing all triples. This aims to create more natural and coherent output, similar to the example provided in the prompt (\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium...\").  This is a crucial step towards improving the BLEU score, as it focuses on generating more complex, human-like sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"error_type\": \"SyntaxError\", \"error_message\": \"invalid syntax (tmp_u0ekn_w.py, line 32)\", \"full_traceback\": \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \\\"/home/inf151915/d2t/problems/triples_to_text/evaluator.py\\\", line 121, in evaluate\\n    spec.loader.exec_module(program)\\n  File \\\"<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>\\\", line 995, in exec_module\\n  File \\\"<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>\\\", line 1133, in get_code\\n  File \\\"<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>\\\", line 1063, in source_to_code\\n  File \\\"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\\\", line 488, in _call_with_frames_removed\\n  File \\\"/tmp/tmp_u0ekn_w.py\\\", line 32\\n    elif predicate == \\\"country\\\":\\n    ^^^^\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n\", \"suggestion\": \"Check for syntax errors or missing imports in the generated code\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
