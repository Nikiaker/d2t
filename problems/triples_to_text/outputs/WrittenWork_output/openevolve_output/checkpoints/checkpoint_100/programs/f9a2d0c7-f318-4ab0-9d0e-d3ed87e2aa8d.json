Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

`combined_info` where keys are subjects and values are dictionaries of predicate-object pairs. This groups all information related to a single subject.\n*   **Conditional Sentence Construction:** It then iterates through the `combined_info` dictionary. For each subject, it constructs a sentence by adding relevant facts based on the available predicates.\n*   **Relationship Handling:**  It includes logic to combine related facts. For example, if both \"country\" and \"capital\" are present for a subject, it includes both in a single clause (\"which has capital...\").\n*   **More Coherent Output:** This approach aims to produce more fluent and informative sentences by combining related information, rather than generating a series of short, isolated statements.\n*   **Improved Complex Sentence Generation:** This change increases the likelihood of creating complex sentences when multiple triples relate to the same subject, addressing the prompt's requirement.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_517\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
