Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

disjointed way of expressing the country and capital relationship. The revised code stores the `country_obj` within the `combined_info` dictionary after encountering the \"country\" predicate. This ensures that when the \"capital\" predicate is processed, the country is readily available.  The phrasing has been changed to \"which is located in {country_obj} with {object_} as its capital\" to create a smoother, more natural sentence structure. This aims to better capture the relationship between the subject, country, and capital in a single, flowing clause.  The `else` condition for capital is also simplified to improve readability. This change should result in more coherent and contextually relevant sentences, potentially improving the BLEU score.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_26\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
