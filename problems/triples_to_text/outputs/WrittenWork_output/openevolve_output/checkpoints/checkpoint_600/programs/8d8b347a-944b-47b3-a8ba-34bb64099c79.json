Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code used a `combined_info` dictionary, which, while attempting to group information by subject, didn't fully leverage the potential for creating a more natural flow in the sentence.  The revised code introduces `subject_map` which creates a list of (predicate, object) pairs for each subject. This allows for more flexible sentence construction and avoids redundant subject mentions. It also adds a space after each complete sentence when multiple triples are processed, making the output more readable. This approach helps to create more complex and coherent sentences from multiple triples."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_27\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
