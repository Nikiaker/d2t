The revised version attempts to integrate the information more naturally into the existing sentence.  By adding \", and\" before stating the relationship, it creates a more cohesive flow, especially when dealing with multiple triples. This addresses a key weakness identified in the feedback \u2013 the program's tendency to produce disjointed sentences.  The initial condition `if sentence:` prevents adding \", and\" at the very beginning when no sentence exists yet.
