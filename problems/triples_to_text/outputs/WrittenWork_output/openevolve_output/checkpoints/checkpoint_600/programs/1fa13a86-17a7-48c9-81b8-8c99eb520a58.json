data engineer specializing in converting data to text. Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: WrittenWork. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

information about `country`, `almaMater`, `doctoralAdvisor`, `nationality`, and `residence`.  It ensures that the information isn't already present in the `sentence`. This prevents redundant statements when multiple triples relate to the same subject and these properties.  This addresses the examples where the program simply appends each triple's information sequentially, resulting in a less natural-sounding sentence. This should help create more concise and readable sentences when multiple triples relate to the same entity."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_143\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
