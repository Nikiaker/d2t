This improved version iterates through all triples and constructs a sentence by adding clauses based on the predicate.  It uses a series of `if/elif` statements to handle each predicate type and create a relevant sentence fragment. This approach allows the function to process multiple triples and generate a more informative and complex sentence, which should lead to a higher BLUE score.  The sentence construction is designed to be grammatically reasonable given the wide variety of predicates.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_94\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
