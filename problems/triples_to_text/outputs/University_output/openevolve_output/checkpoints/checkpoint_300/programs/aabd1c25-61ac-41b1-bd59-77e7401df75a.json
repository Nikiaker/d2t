Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: University. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

ungrammatical sentences.  The provided example sentences often *require* \"The\" and \"is\" for natural flow.  The suggested change reverts to a more standard conjunction handling (using \"and\" for the last clause) and removes the unnecessary and potentially damaging string replacements.  This should produce more natural and grammatically correct sentences, improving the BLEU score. Specifically, the original code's replacement of \" is \" with a space will break sentences like \"The leader of Romania is Klaus Iohannis.\" into \"The leader of Romania Klaus Iohannis.\". Using \"and\" instead of \", \" for the final conjunction is a common practice for better readability.\n\n\n\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
