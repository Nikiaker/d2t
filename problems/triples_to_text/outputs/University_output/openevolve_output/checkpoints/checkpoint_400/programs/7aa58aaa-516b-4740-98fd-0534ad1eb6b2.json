Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: University. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

blocks where triples are combined.  Currently, after combining two triples, the loop continues to the *next* triple (i + 1) as usual. However, since we've already processed the `next_triple`, we need to increment `i` to avoid reprocessing it in the next iteration.  Without this, the `next_triple` would be considered again, leading to redundant or incorrect sentence construction.  This simple fix ensures that related triples are correctly chained together into a single, coherent sentence before moving on to the subsequent triples. This will help the BLEU score by creating more complex sentences that are closer to the reference sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
