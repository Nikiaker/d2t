Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: University. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

replace \" and \" with \", \". This often resulted in awkward phrasing.  The improved code uses `. ` (period and space) as the primary separator. This creates more natural breaks between clauses. Additionally, the replacement of \", .\" with \".\" improves the flow and avoids unnecessary commas before periods. The removal of \" is \" is retained to streamline the phrasing. This change aims to create more readable and grammatically correct sentences, which should improve the BLEU score.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
