Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: University. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This makes the code inflexible and doesn't scale well with more triples or predicates. The proposed changes address this by:\n\n1.  **Using a list to accumulate clauses:** Instead of directly concatenating strings, we store individual clauses in a list called `clauses`. This allows for more control over sentence structure and easier combination of information from multiple triples.\n2.  **Simplified predicate handling:** Each predicate is handled in its own `elif` block, creating a more modular and readable structure.  The clauses are built in a consistent manner.\n3.  **Joining clauses at the end:**  Finally, the `clauses` are joined with commas and a period to form the final sentence.\n\nThis approach will create more coherent and grammatically correct sentences by avoiding the direct string concatenation and providing a more structured way to incorporate information from all triples.  It also makes it easier to add support for new predicates in the future."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_69\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
