Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: University. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

approach:** Instead of continuously appending to a single string, the code now creates a list of independent clauses (`clauses`).\n*   **Simplified Logic:** Removed the initial subject handling and `if i == 0` logic. Each triple is processed to generate a clause.\n*   **Joining Clauses:** The clauses are then joined using \", \" to form a more readable sentence.\n*   **Improved Sentence Ending:** Added a period at the end of the sentence.\n*   **Focus on direct relationships:** The logic is simplified to directly create clauses from the triples. This reduces the chances of creating awkward phrasing.\n\nThis change aims to create more grammatically correct and readable sentences, which should lead to a higher BLEU score.  The original code was prone to creating very long and rambling sentences, which are penalized by BLEU.
