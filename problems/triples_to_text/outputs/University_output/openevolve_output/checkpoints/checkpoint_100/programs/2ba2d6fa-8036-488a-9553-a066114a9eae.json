Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: University.

current program to enhance its BLEU score, focusing on more natural sentence construction and handling multiple triples more effectively:\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    sentence += \", \".join(clauses) + \".\"\n    return sentence.strip()\n=======\n    if clauses:\n        sentence += \" \".join(clauses) + \".\"\n    else:\n        sentence = subject + \".\"\n\n    return sentence.strip()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Explanation of the change:**\n\nThe original code unconditionally joined the `clauses` with \", \".  This often resulted in awkward phrasing, especially when dealing with a small number of triples. The improved code checks if there are any clauses to join. If there are, it joins them with spaces. If there are no clauses (e.g., only a single triple and no additional information), it simply returns the subject with a period. This handles edge cases better and creates more fluent sentences in many scenarios. This adjustment allows for more natural sentence flow, which should improve the BLEU score.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_46\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
