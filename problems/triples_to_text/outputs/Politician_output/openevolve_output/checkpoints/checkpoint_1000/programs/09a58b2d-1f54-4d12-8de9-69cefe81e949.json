Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Politician. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe key change is within the `else` block where the predicates are handled. The original code had nested `if` statements and repetitive checks for `triples[i-1].subject == triple.subject`. This has been simplified to always add \" and \" when adding another fact about the same subject, making the sentence flow more naturally.  This avoids cases where sentences start with \"and\" unnecessarily and creates a more cohesive narrative when multiple triples relate to the same entity. This should help the BLUE score by generating more human-like sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_78\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
