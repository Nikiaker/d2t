This resulted in repetitive phrasing (e.g., \"Adam Holloway party Conservative Party, Adam Holloway nationality United Kingdom\").\n\nThe modification removes the redundant `triple.subject` from the sentence construction within the `else` block.  Instead, it only adds the `predicate` and `object`, assuming the subject has already been established by the first triple in the sequence. This will create a more concise and flowing sentence structure, resembling the example sentences provided in the prompt. For example: \"party Conservative Party, nationality United Kingdom\". This change will improve the coherence and readability of the generated text, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                    else:\n                        if i == len(triples) - 1:\n                            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}.\"\n                        else:\n                            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}, \"\n=======\n                    else:\n                        if i == len(triples) - 1:\n                            sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}. \"\n                        else:\n                            sentence += f\"{triple.predicate} {triple.object}, \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_65\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
