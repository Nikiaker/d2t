original code only handled a few predicates and appended information sequentially, often starting with \"and\". This limits sentence complexity. The improved code addresses this by:\n\n1.  **Handling More Predicates:** It adds handling for `dedicatedTo` and `nativeName`, increasing the range of information that can be included.\n2.  **Building Sentence Parts:** Instead of directly appending to a single string, it builds a list of sentence parts.\n3.  **Joining with Commas:** It joins the sentence parts with commas, creating a more natural flow and allowing for multiple facts to be presented in a single sentence. This is more aligned with the example provided in the problem description and should lead to a higher BLUE score.\n4. **Removing unnecessary \"and\"**: By building a list of sentence parts and joining them, the repetitive use of \"and\" is avoided.\n\nThis approach aims to create more complex and informative sentences, which should improve the BLUE score by better matching the expected output format. It also makes the code more extensible for adding support for additional predicates in the future.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"error_type\": \"AllTrialsFailed\", \"error_message\": \"All trials failed - common issues: timeouts, crashes, or invalid return values\", \"suggestion\": \"Check for infinite loops, ensure function returns a str\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
