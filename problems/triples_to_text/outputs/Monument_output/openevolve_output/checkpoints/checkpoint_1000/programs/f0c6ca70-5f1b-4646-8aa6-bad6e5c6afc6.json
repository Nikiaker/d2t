The revised code aims to create a smoother, more natural sentence structure. Specifically, changing  `{country}'s capital is {triple.object},` to `the capital of {country} is {triple.object}.` and `sentence += f\"which is in {country}. \"` to `sentence += f\" and is located in {country}. \"` makes the sentence flow better. This will improve the coherence and readability of the generated text, which should positively impact the BLEU score.  The use of \"and\" to connect country and location information is also more natural.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        elif triple.predicate == \"capital\":\n            if \"country\" in locals():\n                sentence += f\"{country}'s capital is {triple.object}, \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.object} is the capital of {triple.subject}, \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"country\":\n            country = triple.object\n            sentence += f\"which is in {country}. \"\n=======\n        elif triple.predicate == \"capital\":\n            if \"country\" in locals():\n                sentence += f\"the capital of {country} is {triple.object}. \"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.object} is the capital of {triple.subject}. \"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"country\":\n            country = triple.object\n            sentence += f\" and is located in {country}. \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
