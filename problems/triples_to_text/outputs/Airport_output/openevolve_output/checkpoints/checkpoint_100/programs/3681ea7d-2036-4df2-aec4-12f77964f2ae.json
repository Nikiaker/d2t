Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This allows it to gather all the facts about an airport before constructing the sentence.\n*   **Conditional Sentence Construction:** The final sentence is constructed only if an `airport` is identified. This prevents creating sentences from unrelated triples.\n*   **Combined Sentence:** The `airport_info` list is joined with \" and \" to create a more complex, single sentence.\n*   **Removed Redundancy:** The repeated `if airport:` checks within each predicate block are removed, simplifying the logic.\n\nThis approach should yield sentences that are more coherent and capture more information from the input triples, leading to a higher BLEU score.
