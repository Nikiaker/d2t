Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

else:\n                sentence += f\", and its capital is {triple.object}.\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code's handling of \"country\" and \"capital\" predicates felt slightly awkward, especially when chaining multiple triples together.  The suggested changes aim to make the sentence flow more naturally.\n\n*   **\"country\"**: Changing \"is in\" to \"is located in\" and the subsequent clause to \", which is in\" improves readability and sounds less repetitive.\n*   **\"capital\"**: Changing the initial phrase to \"The capital of...\" and the subsequent clause to \", and its capital is...\" provides a clearer and more standard sentence structure.\n\nThese small adjustments can improve the overall fluency of the generated text, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score, as the generated sentences will more closely resemble the reference sentences in terms of natural language phrasing."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_135\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
