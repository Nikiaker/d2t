Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\nReasoning:\n\nThe original code used \"and\" as a conjunction for all subsequent triples, which can sound repetitive and unnatural. Replacing some \"and\" with \", which is\" or \", and\" creates more complex sentence structures and improves readability. This change specifically targets the \"else\" block where less common predicates are handled, improving sentence flow when multiple less common predicates are encountered. This addresses the issue of the generated sentences sounding simplistic and repetitive as highlighted in the feedback."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_25\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
