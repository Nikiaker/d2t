While functional, it can lead to sentences that feel disjointed and less natural. Replacing \"and\" with \", which\" in some cases (specifically for `isPartOf`, `elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet`, and `elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres`) creates a more relative clause-like structure, improving sentence flow and readability.  This should help the generated sentences more closely resemble the example outputs and thus improve the BLEU score.
