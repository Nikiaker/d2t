Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

and \"capital\" predicates created somewhat awkward phrasing when combined with other triples.  Specifically, using \"located in\" repeatedly and phrasing \"The capital of ... is...\" can be improved.\n\nThe change aims to create more natural-sounding sentences by:\n\n*   Using \"is in\" for the country predicate, which is more common.\n*   Reversing the order for the capital predicate to \"X is the capital of Y\", which reads more smoothly.\n*   Maintaining the \"which is in\" structure for subsequent triples, ensuring a cohesive flow.\n\nThis subtle shift in phrasing should contribute to a higher BLEU score by producing outputs that more closely resemble the reference sentences.
