Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

leading to awkward phrasing.  Also, the capitalization in the capital predicate was not ideal. The revised code removes the unnecessary \"and\" and reframes the sentence structure for both \"country\" and \"capital\" to be more natural and fluent, especially when combined with other triples.  The \"country\" predicate now uses \"which is in\" to connect it more smoothly to previous clauses. The \"capital\" predicate now explicitly states \"The capital of...\", improving readability. This small change should help create more coherent sentences and, therefore, improve the BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_151\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
