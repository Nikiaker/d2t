This can lead to a somewhat choppy and less natural-sounding sentence.  Replacing some of the \"and\" with commas (\",\") creates a more flowing sentence structure, especially when dealing with descriptive attributes.  This adjustment should improve the readability and grammatical correctness of the generated sentences, leading to a higher BLEU score.  The change is focused on the `else` block where the less common predicates are handled, as this is where the sentence structure is most likely to become awkward.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is part of {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" which is part of {triple.object}.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n            else:\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}.\"\n=======\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is part of {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", which is part of {triple.object}.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", and is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", and is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n            else:\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}.\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_135\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
