This subtle modification aims to create a more natural flow in the sentence by avoiding the repetitive \"and is...\" or \"and...\" phrasing, especially when dealing with multiple triples.  The commas will allow the sentence to be more readable, and closer to the example sentences. It changes the sentence structure to be more like a list of attributes.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is part of {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" which is part of {triple.object}.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n            else:\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}.\"\n=======\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is part of {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", which is part of {triple.object}.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", and is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", and is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n            else:\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}.\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_139\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
