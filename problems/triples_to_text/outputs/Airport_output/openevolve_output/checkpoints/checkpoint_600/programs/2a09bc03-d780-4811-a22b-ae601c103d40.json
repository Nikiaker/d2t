Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Airport. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

\"and\" to connect clauses when `first_triple` was `False`.  This often results in choppy, less natural-sounding sentences. Replacing \"and\" with \", which\" or \",\" in several cases will create more complex sentences that are more grammatically correct and easier to read. This subtle change can improve the fluency and coherence of the generated text, which should lead to a higher BLEU score.  I focused on the \"else\" block to make the change as it handles less common predicates and is more likely to benefit from improved sentence structure.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_115\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
