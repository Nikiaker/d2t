This aims to improve the readability and grammatical correctness of sentences formed by combining multiple triples.  The original code's repeated use of \"and\" can create run-on sentences.  Using \", which is\" provides a slightly more sophisticated way to connect related information and should improve the BLUE score by producing more natural-sounding sentences. This targets the identified weakness of the current program in handling complex sentences.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is part of {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" which is part of {triple.object}.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n            else:\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}.\"\n=======\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"isPartOf\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is part of {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", which is part of {triple.object}.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInFeet\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", and is {triple.object} feet above sea level.\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"elevationAboveTheSeaLevelInMetres\":\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\", and is {triple.object} metres above sea level.\"\n            else:\n                if first_triple:\n                    sentence += f\"{triple.subject} {triple.predicate} {triple.object}.\"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}.\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_7\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
