Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

The suggested change reverts to a list of details, and then joins them at the end. This allows for more complex sentence structure and a potentially better BLUE score, as it's more likely to match reference sentences that combine multiple facts into a single sentence. The previous code created fragmented sentences. This change consolidates the information before creating the final sentence."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_106\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
