Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

predicates.  The repeated logic made the code less readable and didn't significantly improve sentence construction. The change consolidates the logic, and more importantly, improves the sentence structure when a country and leader are both present.  Instead of separate clauses (\"...is in... and is led by...\"), the revised code uses a relative clause (\"..., which is in..., is led by...\") to create a smoother, more natural-sounding sentence. This should lead to a higher BLEU score by more closely matching the example correct sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_19\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
