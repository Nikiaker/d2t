While it attempts to handle location and country adjacency, it doesn't fully leverage the relationships between triples. The improved code replaces the comma-based joining with a period and space (\". \"). This change encourages the formation of multiple independent clauses within a single sentence, leading to more complex and potentially more natural-sounding sentences, which should improve the BLEU score.
