Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

located in \" in detail` to check if the split string exists before attempting the split. This prevents errors if the triple is not formatted exactly as expected. Also added a split by `country` just in case the predicate is country.\n*   **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `country_name`, `location_name`, and `capital_name` improves readability.\n*   **Simplified Combination Logic:** The combined detail strings are now more concise and readable.\n*   **Handles more cases:** Added handling for `country` and `capital` combination before the `location`, `country`, `capital` combination.\n\nThis improvement focuses on making the sentence generation more robust and clearer when combining related triples, which should lead to a higher BLEU score by producing sentences that are closer to the example correct sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_83\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
