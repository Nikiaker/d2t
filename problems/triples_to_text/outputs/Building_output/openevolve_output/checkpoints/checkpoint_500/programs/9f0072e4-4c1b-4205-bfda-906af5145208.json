Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: architecturalStyle - Example triple: (103 Colmore Row | architecturalStyle | Brutalist architecture)\nPredicate: buildingStartDate - Example triple: (103 Colmore Row | buildingStartDate | \"1973\")\nPredicate: completionDate - Example triple: (103 Colmore Row | completionDate | 1976)\nPredicate: floorCount - Example triple: (103 Colmore Row | floorCount | 23)\nPredicate: location - Example triple: (103 Colmore Row | location | \"Colmore Row, Birmingham, England\")\nPredicate: cost - Example triple: (108 St Georges Terrace | cost | \"120 million (Australian dollars)\")\nPredicate: floorArea - Example triple: (108 St Georges Terrace | floorArea | 39500.0 (square metres))\nPredicate: architect - Example triple: (11 Diagonal Street | architect | Helmut Jahn)\nPredicate: owner - Example triple: (11 Diagonal Street | owner | Redefine Properties Limited)\nPredicate: formerName - Example triple: (320 South Boston Building | formerName | \"Exchange National Bank Building\")\nPredicate: height - Example triple: (320 South Boston Building | height | 121.92 (metres))\nPredicate: buildingType - Example triple: (3Arena | buildingType | \"Concert and events venue\")\nPredicate: developer - Example triple: (AC Hotel Bella Sky Copenhagen | developer | Bella Center)\nPredicate: tenant - Example triple: (AC Hotel Bella Sky Copenhagen | tenant | Marriott International)\nPredicate: isPartOf - Example triple: (Adare | isPartOf | Munster)\nPredicate: country - Example triple: (Addis Ababa | country | Ethiopia)\nPredicate: currentTenants - Example triple: (Addis Ababa City Hall | currentTenants | \"Government of Addis Ababa\")\nPredicate: address - Example triple: (Adisham Hall | address | \"St. Benedict's Monastery, Adisham, Haputhale, Sri Lanka\")\nPredicate: inaugurationDate - Example triple: (Alan B.

It searches for associated triples within the `triples` list based on the subject.  This simplifies the logic and improves the chances of correctly combining location, country, and capital information into a single, coherent sentence.  The revised code attempts to find location and capital triples related to the current country triple and constructs a sentence if both are found.
