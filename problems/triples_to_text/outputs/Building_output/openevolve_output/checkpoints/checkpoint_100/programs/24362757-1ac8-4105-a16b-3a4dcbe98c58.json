Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

in somewhat choppy and repetitive sentences.  Replacing \"and\" with \", \" improves the flow and readability.  Also, I've changed some of the phrasing (e.g., \"is built in\" to \"which is built in\") to create more natural-sounding sentences and avoid starting every detail with the same phrase.  This should help the model generate sentences that are closer to the expected output and thus improve the BLEU score.
