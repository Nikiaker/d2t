Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This creates a smoother flow by avoiding repeating the subject.\n2.  **Concise phrasing:** Reformulated some phrases to be more concise and natural (e.g., \"built in\" instead of \"is built in\").\n3.  **Improved Conjunctions:** Replaced the `and` conjunctions within the loop with commas for better readability and flow. The final sentence is constructed using `, `.join() to connect the sentence parts.\n4.  **Simplified Structure:** The `if sentence_parts` check handles the case where no relevant information is found, preventing errors and ensuring a graceful return.\n\nThese changes should result in more complex, fluent, and grammatically correct sentences, ultimately improving the BLUE score by generating outputs that more closely resemble the reference sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_92\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
