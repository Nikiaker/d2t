Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

disconnected statements. The improved code groups triples by their subject. This allows it to collect all the details about a single entity (e.g., a building) and then construct a single, more complex sentence that combines those details using commas and conjunctions. This approach should lead to more fluent and coherent sentences, and therefore a higher BLEU score.  The `else` clause ensures that any predicates not explicitly handled still get included in the sentence.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_9\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
