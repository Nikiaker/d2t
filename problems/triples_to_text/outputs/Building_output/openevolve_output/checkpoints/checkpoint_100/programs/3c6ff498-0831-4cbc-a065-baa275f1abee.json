Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

conditional structure that heavily relied on the index `i` to determine how to phrase the sentence. This made it difficult to create complex, flowing sentences with multiple attributes.\n\nThe improved code replaces this with a list `sentence_parts`. It iterates through the triples and appends a descriptive phrase to this list based on the predicate.  Finally, it joins these phrases with commas and constructs the final sentence.  This approach is more flexible and allows for a more natural-sounding sentence when multiple triples are provided.  It also avoids redundant phrasing.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_98\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
