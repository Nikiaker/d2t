Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This is crucial for creating more coherent sentences.\n*   **Combined Sentence Construction:**  For each subject, it iterates through the related triples and appends descriptive phrases to a `details` list. Finally, it joins these phrases into a single sentence.\n*   **Improved Sentence Structure:** Using phrases like \"which is built in...\", \"costing...\", \"with... floors\" instead of simple \"subject predicate object\" constructs results in more natural-sounding sentences.\n*   **Removed Redundancy:** The original code generated a separate sentence for each triple, leading to repetitive and fragmented output.  This version eliminates that redundancy.\n*   **Maintain Predicate Handling:** All original predicates are still handled.\n*   **Improved Readability**: The code is organized to make the logic more apparent.\n\nThis change should lead to a significant improvement in the BLEU score, as it generates more complex and coherent sentences that better capture the relationships between the triples.  The previous version was essentially just concatenating simple statements, while this version attempts to build a more natural narrative."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_121\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
