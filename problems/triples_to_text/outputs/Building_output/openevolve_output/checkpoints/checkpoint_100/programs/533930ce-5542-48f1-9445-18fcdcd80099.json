Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Building. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\n\nKey changes and rationale:\n\n*   **Collect Clauses:** Instead of immediately appending to the sentence, the code now collects individual clauses (phrases representing each triple) in a list called `clauses`.\n*   **Join with Commas:** After processing all triples, the `clauses` are joined using \", \" as a separator, and a period is added at the end to form a complete sentence.\n*   **Consistent Subject:** Uses the first triple's subject as the primary subject for all clauses, improving coherence.  This addresses the problem of repeating the subject unnecessarily.\n*   **Removed redundant location check:** The location check in the country predicate was unnecessary.\n*   **Improved Sentence Structure:** This approach creates more complex and natural-sounding sentences by combining multiple pieces of information into a single statement.  This directly addresses the low BLEU scores observed in the examples, which often required combining information from multiple triples.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_23\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
