Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

Changed \"and is a\" to \"is a\", \"and its leader is\" to \"is led by\", etc. This makes each clause sound more complete.\n*   **Ending with periods:**  Added periods to the end of each clause to create more natural sentence breaks.\n*   **Removed unnecessary conjunctions:** Removed excessive use of \"and\" to create a smoother flow.\n*   **Improved phrasing:** Changed some phrasing for better readability (e.g., \"uses the currency\" -> \"uses as its currency\").\n\nThis change focuses on improving the quality of individual clauses, which should lead to a better overall sentence structure and a higher BLEU score.  It aims to create more grammatically correct and natural-sounding sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_620\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
