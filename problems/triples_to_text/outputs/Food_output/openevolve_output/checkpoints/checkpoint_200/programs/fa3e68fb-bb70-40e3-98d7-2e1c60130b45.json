Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

REPLACE\n```\nRationale:\n\nThe changes aim to make the sentence flow more naturally by removing redundant phrases like \"sentence += f\" and using more concise and direct phrasing (e.g., \"created by {object_val}\" instead of \"created by {object_val} \").  Also, adding periods to the end of clauses where appropriate, to separate ideas and improve readability. This can help the BLEU score by aligning the generated sentences closer to the reference sentences in terms of phrasing and punctuation.  This focuses on improving the grammatical correctness and readability of the generated sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_609\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
