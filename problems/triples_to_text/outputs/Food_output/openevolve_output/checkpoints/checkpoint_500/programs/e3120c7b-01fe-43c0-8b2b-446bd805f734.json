Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

for `dishVariation`.  Changing  `\", a variation of {object_val}.\"` to `\" and can be a variation of {object_val}.\"` allows for a slightly smoother integration of this property into the overall sentence, particularly when multiple properties are present. It avoids starting a new clause with \"a variation of\" and integrates it more naturally. This small adjustment can contribute to better sentence fluency and potentially improve the BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_50\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
