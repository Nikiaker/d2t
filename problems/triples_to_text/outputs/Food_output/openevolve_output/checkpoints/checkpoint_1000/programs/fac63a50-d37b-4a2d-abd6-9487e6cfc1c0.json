Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This is a subtle change, but it addresses a tendency for the generated sentences to run together without proper separation between phrases.  By adding a space after each phrase, the resulting sentences should be more readable and grammatically correct, potentially improving the BLEU score. It makes the sentence structure more natural."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_240\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
