Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food.

Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.
