Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

It primarily concatenates clauses with \"and\", resulting in a choppy and unnatural output. To improve fluency, we can introduce more sophisticated sentence structuring, particularly using relative clauses and coordinating conjunctions beyond just \"and\".

introduces conditional logic within the `else` block to handle specific predicate combinations (country, region, ingredient) more intelligently. Specifically, if the sentence already \"contains\" an ingredient and the current predicate is \"country\", it rewrites the sentence to combine the information using \"which is from\".  Similarly, if the sentence already includes a \"country\" and the predicate is \"region\", it appends \"located in the [region]\" to create a more natural flow. This is a small but targeted improvement aimed at creating more complex and coherent sentences when multiple related triples are present. This should improve the BLUE score by creating sentences closer to the reference sentences."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_290\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
