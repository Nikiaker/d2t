The change replaces \"Additionally\" with more varied sentence structures and uses periods to separate clauses, creating a smoother flow.  The revised code also uses \"It contains\" or \"It was created\" for nutritional facts and creation years, making the sentences sound more natural. This should improve fluency and coherence, and thus, the BLUE score. Using more complete sentences for each triple instead of just adding another clause improves readability and coherence.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                elif predicate == \"servingTemperature\":\n                    sentence += f\" and is served {object_val} \"\n                elif predicate == \"class\":\n                    sentence += f\" which is a {object_val} \"\n                elif predicate == \"carbohydrate\":\n                    sentence += f\" with {object_val}g of carbohydrate \"\n                elif predicate == \"fat\":\n                    sentence += f\" and contains {object_val}g of fat \"\n                elif predicate == \"year\":\n                    sentence += f\" in the year {object_val} \"\n                elif predicate == \"protein\":\n                    sentence += f\" with {object_val}g of protein \"\n                elif predicate == \"servingSize\":\n                    sentence += f\" with a serving size of {object_val}g \"\n                elif predicate == \"order\":\n                    sentence += f\" which is a member of the {object_val} order \"\n                elif predicate == \"family\":\n                    sentence += f\" which belongs to the {object_val} family \"\n                elif predicate == \"division\":\n                    sentence += f\" which is a {object_val} division \"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and its {predicate} is {object_val}.\"\n                if triple != triples[-1]:\n                    sentence += \" Additionally, \"\n=======\n                elif predicate == \"servingTemperature\":\n                    sentence += f\" and is served {object_val}. \"\n                elif predicate == \"class\":\n                    sentence += f\" which is a {object_val}. \"\n                elif predicate == \"carbohydrate\":\n                    sentence += f\" It contains {object_val}g of carbohydrate. \"\n                elif predicate == \"fat\":\n                    sentence += f\" It contains {object_val}g of fat. \"\n                elif predicate == \"year\":\n                    sentence += f\" It was created in the year {object_val}. \"\n                elif predicate == \"protein\":\n                    sentence += f\" It contains {object_val}g of protein. \"\n                elif predicate == \"servingSize\":\n                    sentence += f\" A serving size is {object_val}g. \"\n                elif predicate == \"order\":\n                    sentence += f\" It belongs to the {object_val} order. \"\n                elif predicate == \"family\":\n                    sentence += f\" It is part of the {object_val} family. \"\n                elif predicate == \"division\":\n                    sentence += f\" It is a {object_val} division. \"\n                else:\n                    sentence += f\" and its {predicate} is {object_val}. \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_361\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
