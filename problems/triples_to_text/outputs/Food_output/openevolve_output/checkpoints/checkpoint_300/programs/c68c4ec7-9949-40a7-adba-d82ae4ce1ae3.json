Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

each. This can lead to fragmented and less coherent text when multiple triples relate to different subjects.\n\nThe improved code checks if there's only one subject. If so, it constructs a sentence as before. However, if there are multiple subjects, it combines all the information into a single, more complex sentence. It does this by creating a list of clauses for each subject and then joining them with commas and \"and\" to create a more fluent sentence.  This addresses the issue of generating a single, comprehensive sentence when appropriate, as highlighted in the problem description and examples. This should lead to a better BLUE score by more closely matching the reference sentences' structure.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_619\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
