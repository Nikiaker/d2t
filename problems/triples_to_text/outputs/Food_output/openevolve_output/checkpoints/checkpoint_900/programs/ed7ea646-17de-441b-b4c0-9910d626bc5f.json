Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

predicate-specific phrases. This aims to create a more natural flow when multiple predicates are present, rather than just listing facts one after another.  It also makes the sentence more grammatically correct and readable.  The modifications to the `else` block within the `else` statement aim to make the generated sentences more cohesive and less choppy when multiple triples are processed.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_305\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
