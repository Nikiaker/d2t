Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Food. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

The changes aim to introduce more variety in sentence structure and conjunctions.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n*   **`creatorOfDish`**: Changed \"created by\" to \"which was created by\" for better flow.\n*   **`ethnicGroup`**: Changed \"is associated with\" to \"is home to\" which is a more natural way of expressing the relationship.\n*   **`leader`**: Changed \"its leader is\" to \"is led by\" to vary the phrasing.\n*   **`leaderTitle`**: Changed \"with the leader title of\" to \"with a leader titled\" for a slightly smoother read.\n*   **`demonym`**: Changed \"people are known as\" to \"its people are called\".\n*   **`currency`**: Changed \"uses the currency\" to \"its currency is\".\n*   **`officialLanguage`**: Changed \"the official language is\" to \"its official language is\".\n\nThese subtle changes should lead to more fluent and natural-sounding sentences, potentially improving the BLEU score by better matching the stylistic characteristics of the reference sentences. The goal is to reduce the predictability of the generated text and make it more closely resemble human-written language."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_191\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
