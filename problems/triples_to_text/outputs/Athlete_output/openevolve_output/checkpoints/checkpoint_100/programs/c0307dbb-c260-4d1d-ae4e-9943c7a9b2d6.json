Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

The improved code generates a list of individual sentences, one for each triple.  Then, it joins these sentences with commas and a final period. This approach produces more grammatically correct and readable output, and can handle a larger variety of predicates effectively. The use of f-strings for each predicate makes the code more concise and easier to read and maintain. The direct assignment of predicate values to sentences is a more organized approach. This should significantly improve the BLEU score by generating more natural-sounding sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_151\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
