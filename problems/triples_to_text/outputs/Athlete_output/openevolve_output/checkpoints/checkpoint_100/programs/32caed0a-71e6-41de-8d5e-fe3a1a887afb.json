Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

 Introduced \"who\" to create relative clauses, linking multiple properties to the subject in a more grammatically correct way. This aims to create more complex and readable sentences.\n*   **Expanded predicate handling:** Added handling for `birthYear`, `height` and `weight` predicates to generate more informative sentences.\n*   **Removed unnecessary `i` variable:**  The original code's use of `i` was redundant, as we iterate through all triples regardless of their position.\n*   **Simplified logic:** The `if/else` structure is streamlined.\n*   **Removed strip()** The strip() function is unnecessary as the joining of the clauses ensures there's no leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nThis approach should generate more coherent and natural-sounding sentences, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score by more closely matching the reference sentences' style and structure.
