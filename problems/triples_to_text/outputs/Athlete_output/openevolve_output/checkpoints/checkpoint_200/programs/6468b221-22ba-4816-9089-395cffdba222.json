Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

incrementally, which leads to awkward phrasing and doesn't handle multiple triples gracefully. The revised code generates a list of individual sentences, one for each triple.  This approach provides better structure and readability.  Joining the sentences at the end with \" \" and adding a final period creates a more natural-sounding result. I also added `formerTeam` to the conditional statements to improve the handling of more predicates. This should result in a higher BLEU score because the generated sentences will be more similar to the example correct sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_1\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
