Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

This often results in a disjointed and less informative output. The proposed change aims to create a single, more complex sentence by combining information from multiple triples using relative clauses (\"who\", \"and\").  By starting with the subject and appending clauses based on the predicates, we can create a more natural and coherent sentence structure, which should improve the BLEU score by better reflecting the relationships between the entities in the data. This approach is similar to the inspiration programs.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_143\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
