Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

Logic & Clause Building:**  Instead of managing sentence construction with `if i > 0` and repetitive `elif` blocks, the code now builds a list of `clauses`.\n*   **Improved Conjunction Handling:** Uses `\", \".join(clauses[1:])` to efficiently join all clauses after the first one with commas.\n*   **Conciseness:** Removes redundant code and streamlines the process of creating the final sentence.\n*   **Handles Empty/Single Triple Cases:** Correctly handles cases with no triples or only one triple.\n\nThis approach should result in more fluent and grammatically correct sentences, especially when dealing with multiple triples, leading to a higher BLUE score.  The focus is on creating a more natural flow of information, similar to how a person would express these relationships."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_59\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
