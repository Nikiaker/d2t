Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

**Collect Properties:** Instead of directly appending to the sentence in a loop, the code now collects all properties into a list called `properties`.\n*   **Join with Commas:** After collecting all properties, it joins them with \", \" to create a more natural-sounding sentence.\n*   **Handles More Predicates:** Expanded the conditional statements to handle all possible predicates in a consistent manner.\n*   **Improved Sentence Structure:** This approach avoids repetitive \"and\" conjunctions, resulting in a more fluent and readable sentence, especially when multiple triples are involved. This should significantly improve the BLEU score.\n* **Removed Redundant Code**: Removed the initial if block and its redundant code.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_6\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
