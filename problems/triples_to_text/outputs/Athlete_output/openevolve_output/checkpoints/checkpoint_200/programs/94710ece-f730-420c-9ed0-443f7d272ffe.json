Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

of Changes:**\n\nThe original code tried to build the sentence incrementally, handling the first triple differently.  This led to less natural-sounding sentences. The revised code iterates through all triples and generates a sentence part for each one consistently. This simplifies the logic and allows for more flexible sentence construction.  It removes the special handling of the first triple and builds the sentence by appending clauses for each triple. This should lead to better overall fluency. The sentence parts are also terminated with a period, improving readability. This approach should generate sentences that are more grammatically correct and closer to the examples provided.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_26\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
