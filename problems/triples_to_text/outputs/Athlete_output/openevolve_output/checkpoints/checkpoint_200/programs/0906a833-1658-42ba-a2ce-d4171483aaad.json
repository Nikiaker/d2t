Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: league - Example triple: (A.C.

reasoning:\n\n*   **Clause-based approach:** Instead of directly appending to the sentence in the loop, the code now builds a list of clauses.\n*   **\"and\" conjunction:**  The clauses are joined with \"and\" to create a more natural-sounding complex sentence, similar to the example provided in the prompt.\n*   **Starting with the subject:** The sentence begins with the subject from the first triple, ensuring it's the focal point.\n*   **Handles empty input:** Added a check for an empty list of triples to avoid errors.\n\nThis approach should improve the fluency and coherence of the
