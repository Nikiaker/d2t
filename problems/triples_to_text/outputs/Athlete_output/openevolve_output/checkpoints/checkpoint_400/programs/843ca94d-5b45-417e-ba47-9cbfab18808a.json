Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

original code assumes there will always be at least one clause. If the input `triples` list is empty, the program doesn't handle this gracefully. Also, the current clause joining logic can be improved to handle cases with only one clause more efficiently. The proposed change adds a check for a single clause and returns the sentence directly in that case, avoiding unnecessary looping and ensuring a correct sentence structure even with minimal input.  This addresses a potential edge case and improves the overall robustness and readability of the code.
