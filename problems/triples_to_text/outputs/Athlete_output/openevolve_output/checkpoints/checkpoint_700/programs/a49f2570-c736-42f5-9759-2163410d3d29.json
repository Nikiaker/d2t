Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This was an attempt to create more complex sentences but resulted in awkward phrasing and wasn't consistently applied.  The revised code removes this special case, resulting in a more consistent and natural flow of clauses connected by commas and \"and\".  This change aims to simplify the sentence structure and reduce the likelihood of creating grammatically awkward sentences. This will help with the BLEU score as it will create more sentences similar to the example correct sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_10\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
