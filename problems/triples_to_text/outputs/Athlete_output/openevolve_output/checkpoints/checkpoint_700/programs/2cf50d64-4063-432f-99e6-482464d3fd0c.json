Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

current program, focusing on creating more natural-sounding sentence structures and handling multiple triples more effectively. The key idea is to use conjunctions like \"who\" and \"which\" to combine related information, and to prioritize certain predicates (like birth information) to appear earlier in the sentence for better readability.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    sentence = f\"{subject} \"\n    if clauses:\n        sentence += \", \".join(clauses[:-1])\n        if len(clauses) > 1:\n            sentence += f\" and {clauses[-1]}\"\n        else:\n            sentence += clauses[0]\n    sentence += \".\"\n=======\n    sentence = f\"{subject}\"\n    if clauses:\n        sentence += \" who \" + \", \".join(clauses[:-1])\n        if len(clauses) > 1:\n            sentence += f\" and {clauses[-1]}\"\n        else:\n            sentence += f\" {clauses[0]}\"\n    sentence += \".\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n**Explanation of the change:**\n\nThe original code added a space after the subject and then joined the clauses with commas and \"and\". This can lead to somewhat choppy sentences.\n\nThe revised code adds \"who \" before joining the clauses. This creates a more natural flow, as it introduces the clauses as descriptive information *about* the subject.  This approach mimics how humans would typically construct sentences with multiple attributes. It will likely improve the BLEU score because the generated sentences will be more similar to the reference sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_57\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
