Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

While conceptually good, it was limited and didn't handle other relationships well.  The revised code simplifies this by consistently adding \"and\" before all clauses *except* the first one. This creates a more natural flow for multiple attributes. Removing the specific \"country\" logic makes the code more general and avoids potentially awkward phrasing in other scenarios.
