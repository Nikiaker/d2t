Specifically, it replaces the `if i == len(clauses) - 1:` block's conditional `sentence_parts.append(f\"and {clause}\")` with `sentence_parts.append(f\"and which is located in {clause.split('is from ')[-1] if 'is from' in clause else clause.split('is ')[-1]}\")` and the `else` clause `sentence_parts.append(f\", {clause}\")` with `sentence_parts.append(f\", and which is located in {clause.split('is from ')[-1] if 'is from' in clause else clause.split('is ')[-1]}\")`. This will create a more cohesive sentence. By consistently using \"and which is located in\" for location-based clauses, it improves the flow and readability of the generated text when multiple location triples are present. This addresses the example given in the problem description and improves the overall coherence of the sentences produced.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if clauses:\n        sentence_parts = []\n        for i, clause in enumerate(clauses):\n            if i == 0:\n                sentence_parts.append(clause)\n            elif i == len(clauses) - 1:\n                if \"country\" in clause or \"city\" in clause:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\"which is located in {clause.split('is from ')[-1] if 'is from' in clause else clause.split('is ')[-1]}\")\n                else:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\"and {clause}\")\n            else:\n                if \"country\" in clause or \"city\" in clause:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\", which is located in {clause.split('is from ')[-1] if 'is from' in clause else clause.split('is ')[-1]}\")\n                else:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\", {clause}\")\n        sentence += \" \".join(sentence_parts)\n=======\n    if clauses:\n        sentence_parts = []\n        for i, clause in enumerate(clauses):\n            if i == 0:\n                sentence_parts.append(clause)\n            elif i == len(clauses) - 1:\n                if \"country\" in clause or \"city\" in clause:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\"and which is located in {clause.split('is from ')[-1] if 'is from' in clause else clause.split('is ')[-1]}\")\n                else:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\"and {clause}\")\n            else:\n                if \"country\" in clause or \"city\" in clause:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\", and which is located in {clause.split('is from ')[-1] if 'is from' in clause else clause.split('is ')[-1]}\")\n                else:\n                    sentence_parts.append(f\", {clause}\")\n        sentence += \" \".join(sentence_parts)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_18\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
