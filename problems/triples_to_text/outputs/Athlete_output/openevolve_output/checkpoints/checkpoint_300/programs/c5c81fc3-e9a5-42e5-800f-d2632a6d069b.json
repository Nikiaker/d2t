Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

casing the first triple.  Instead, all triples are processed in the same way.\n*   **Built a list of clauses:** This allows us to collect all the descriptive phrases from the triples and then join them together with commas. This generally leads to more grammatically correct and fluent sentences.\n*   **More concise clause construction:** Removed unnecessary words like \"and\" and simplified the phrasing within each clause.\n*   **Consistent phrasing:**  Used a consistent structure for each clause (e.g., \"plays in the...\", \"is managed by...\"). This improves readability and fluency.\n*   **Removed redundant `else`:** The original `else` clause was very generic and didn't add much value. This change makes the code more focused.\n*   **Combined subject and clauses:** The subject is prepended directly to the joined clauses for a cleaner sentence structure.\n\nThis change aims to create more complex and natural-sounding sentences by treating all triples equally and building a cohesive description of the subject.
