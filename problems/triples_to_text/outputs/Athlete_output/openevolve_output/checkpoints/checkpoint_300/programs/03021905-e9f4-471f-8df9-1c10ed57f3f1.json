Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: Athlete. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

["Here's a suggested improvement to the current program, focusing on creating more natural-sounding sentences by handling multiple clauses more gracefully and introducing conditional phrasing:\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i, clause in enumerate(clauses):\n        if i == 0:\n            sentence += clause\n        else:\n            sentence += f\" and {clause}\" if i ==

    else:\n            sentence += f\", {clauses[i]}\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code's conditional logic (`if i == 0 else f\" and {clause}\" if i == len(clauses) - 1 else f\", {clause}\"`) is a bit convoluted and can lead to awkward phrasing. The revised code simplifies this by directly appending the first clause and then iterating through the remaining clauses, adding \"and\" before the last clause and commas before the others.  This approach is more readable and produces more natural-sounding sentences. Specifically, removing the nested `if` condition makes the code easier to follow and reduces the risk of subtle errors in sentence construction. It also avoids unnecessary repetition of the subject.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_111\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
