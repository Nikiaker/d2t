Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This should help with fluency.\n*   **Removed unnecessary conditional check:** The `if i == 0` makes sure the subject is only printed at the beginning of the sentence.\n*   **Removed extra spaces:** Removed trailing spaces in many of the conditions.\n\nThis revision focuses on creating more grammatically correct and readable sentences by refining the way information is combined from multiple triples.
