Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

Removing \"its\" makes the sentence flow more naturally.\n2.  **Added `replace` for `isPartOf`**: This improves the phrasing of the sentence when the `isPartOf` predicate is encountered. Replacing \"which is part of\" with \"that is part of\" can improve readability.\n\nThis small change focuses on improving the phrasing and reducing redundancy, potentially leading to a higher BLEU score by generating more natural-sounding sentences.
