This leads to repetitive and awkward sentence structures, especially when dealing with multiple triples. The proposed change introduces specific handling for predicates like `populationDensity`, `timeZone`, `governmentType`, and `type`. This allows for more natural phrasing (e.g., \"with a population density of...\" instead of \"and its populationDensity is...\") and improves the overall coherence of the generated text.  By handling these common predicates more gracefully, the program can generate more fluent and informative sentences, which should improve the BLEU score. The `else` statement handles any other predicates to avoid breaking the program.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            sentence += f\" and its {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}\"\n=======\n        else:\n            if triple.predicate == \"populationDensity\":\n                sentence += f\" with a population density of {triple.object} \"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"timeZone\":\n                sentence += f\" and is in the {triple.object} time zone\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"governmentType\":\n                sentence += f\" and has a {triple.object} government\"\n            elif triple.predicate == \"type\":\n                sentence += f\" and is a {triple.object}\"\n            else:\n                sentence += f\" and its {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_188\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
