Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

Adding a comma (`, `) at the end of each clause (except for the last one, which can be handled separately if needed) will improve sentence flow and readability, making it more natural language-like.  This change will help the BLEU score by aligning the generated text closer to the reference sentences in terms of punctuation and phrasing. This addresses a common weakness observed in the previous evaluations."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_65\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
