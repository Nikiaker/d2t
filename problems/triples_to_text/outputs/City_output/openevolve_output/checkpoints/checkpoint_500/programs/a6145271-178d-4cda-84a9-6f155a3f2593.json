Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This leads to choppy, unnatural sentences, especially with multiple triples. Replacing the \", \" with \" and \" improves sentence flow and grammatical correctness. The \"and\" conjunction creates a more cohesive and readable sentence when multiple facts are combined. This change should result in a higher BLEU score as it brings the generated text closer to the reference sentences in terms of fluency and grammatical structure.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_57\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
