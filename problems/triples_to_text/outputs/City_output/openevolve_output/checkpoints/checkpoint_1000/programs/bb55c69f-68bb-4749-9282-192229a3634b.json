Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

code appends clauses to the sentence with a period, creating short, choppy sentences when multiple triples are present. Adding a comma (`,`) at the end of each clause (except potentially the last one which could be handled with additional logic) encourages the creation of longer, more complex sentences that read more naturally.  This simple change can significantly improve the flow and coherence of the generated text, potentially boosting the BLEU score.
