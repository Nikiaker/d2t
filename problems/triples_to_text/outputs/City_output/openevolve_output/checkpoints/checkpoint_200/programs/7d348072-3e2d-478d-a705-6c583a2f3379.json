Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

REPLACE\n```\n\nKey changes and rationale:\n\n*   **Removed `subject` variable and initial `if not sentence` block:** This simplifies the loop and avoids unnecessary initialization. The subject is now always taken directly from the triple.\n*   **Added commas after most clauses:**  Crucially, commas are added to nearly every clause (e.g., `is in {triple.object},`). This creates a more natural flow and allows for the construction of longer, more complex sentences by chaining multiple facts about the same subject.\n*   **Removed trailing comma:** The final `strip(\", \")` removes any trailing comma that might be left at the end of the sentence.\n\nThis modification will likely improve the BLUE score by generating more complex, grammatically correct, and readable sentences that better reflect the relationships expressed in the input triples.  The addition of commas allows the program to combine multiple facts into a single sentence, which is a key aspect of good natural language generation."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_31\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
