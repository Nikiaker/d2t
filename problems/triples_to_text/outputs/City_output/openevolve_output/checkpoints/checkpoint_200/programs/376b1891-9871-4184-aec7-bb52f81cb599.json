Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\nRationale:\n\nThe changes focus on improving the flow of the generated sentences. Replacing \"and is part of\" with \", which is part of\" creates a smoother connection.  Removing redundant phrasing like \"having an area of water of\" to just \"and has an area of water of\" improves conciseness. Using \"with\" instead of \"and has\" in some cases also improves readability. These changes aim to produce more natural-sounding sentences, which should lead to a higher BLEU score."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_102\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
