Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: City. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Change:**\n\nThe original code's `else` block appended phrases with varying conjunctions (\"with\", \"and\", etc.). This resulted in choppy sentences, especially when multiple triples were present.\n\nThe improved code adds a comma (`,`) to the end of each appended phrase within the `else` block.  Additionally, `rstrip(\", \")` is added to the `return` statement to remove any trailing comma that might be left at the end of the sentence if the last triple falls into the `else` condition.\n\nThis change aims to create a more flowing sentence structure by treating each piece of information as a clause separated by commas, making the overall output more readable and natural-sounding.  It facilitates combining multiple facts into a single, more complex sentence, which should improve the BLUE score by better matching reference sentences that exhibit similar complexity.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_44\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
