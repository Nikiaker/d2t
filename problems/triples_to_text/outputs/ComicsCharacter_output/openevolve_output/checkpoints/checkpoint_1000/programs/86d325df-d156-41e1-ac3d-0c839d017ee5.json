Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: ComicsCharacter. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

on better sentence flow when multiple relations exist for a single subject, specifically aiming to connect related facts more naturally:\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        else:\n            if len(sentence_parts) > 1:\n                combined_sentence += f\"{subject}, {', '.join(sentence_parts)}. \"\n            else:\n                combined_sentence += f\"{subject} {sentence_parts[0]}. \"\n=======\n        else:\n            if len(sentence_parts) > 1:\n                combined_sentence += f\"{subject}, who {', '.join(sentence_parts[:-1])} and {sentence_parts[-1]}. \"\n            else:\n                combined_sentence += f\"{subject} {sentence_parts[0]}. \"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Explanation of the change:**\n\nThe original code simply joined sentence parts with commas when there were multiple relations for a subject. This resulted in a list-like structure that lacked coherence.\n\nThe modified code introduces \"who\" to connect the sentence parts, creating a more natural flow.  For example, instead of \"Auron (comicsCharacter), has a full name of 'Lambien', was created by Karl Kesel.\", it will generate \"Auron (comicsCharacter), who has a full name of 'Lambien' and was created by Karl Kesel.\". This small change improves readability and potentially the BLEU score by aligning more closely with the example correct sentences. I am keeping the previous change as well to improve the outcome.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_7\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
