Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: ComicsCharacter. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

original code incrementally builds the sentence string within the loop, which leads to repetitive phrasing and a less natural flow. The revised code collects all the information into a list of clauses and then joins them together at the end, resulting in a more coherent and readable sentence. It also removes the redundant initial `subject` addition inside the loop, ensuring the subject is only added once. The conditional statement ensures that an empty sentence is not generated if the `clauses` list is empty. This is a more robust and flexible approach that should improve the overall quality and fluency of the generated text, leading to a higher BLUE score. Also, I have made some minor improvements to the phrasing within the clauses themselves."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_54\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
