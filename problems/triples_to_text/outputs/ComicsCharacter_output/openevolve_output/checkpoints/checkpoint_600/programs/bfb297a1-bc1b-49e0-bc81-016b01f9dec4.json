This often resulted in fragmented sentences. The revised code leverages the `subject` variable to track the current subject being described. If a `subject` exists (meaning we've already started describing it), it appends the new information as a relative clause using \"which\" or \"as part of\", creating a more connected and natural-sounding sentence.  This addresses the primary issue of creating short, disjointed sentences when multiple triples relate to the same subject. The last `else` statement was also modified to include \"The\" before the predicate to improve the sentence structure.\n\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        elif triple.predicate == \"broadcastedBy\":\n            if sentence:\n                sentence += f\" and is broadcasted by {triple.object}.\"\n            else:\n                sentence = f\"{triple.subject} is broadcasted by {triple.object}.\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"firstAired\":\n            if sentence:\n                sentence += f\" It first aired on {triple.object}.\"\n            else:\n                sentence = f\"{triple.subject} first aired on {triple.object}.\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"series\":\n            if sentence:\n                sentence += f\" and is part of the {triple.object} series.\"\n            else:\n                sentence = f\"{triple.subject} is part of the {triple.object} series.\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"child\":\n            if sentence:\n                sentence += f\" and has a child named {triple.object}.\"\n            else:\n                sentence = f\"{triple.subject}'s child is {triple.object}.\"\n        else:\n            sentence += f\"The {triple.predicate} of {triple.subject} is {triple.object}. \"\n=======\n        elif triple.predicate == \"broadcastedBy\":\n            if subject is None:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is broadcast on {triple.object}.\"\n                subject = triple.subject\n            else:\n                sentence += f\", which is broadcast on {triple.object}.\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"firstAired\":\n            if subject is None:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} first aired on {triple.object}.\"\n                subject = triple.subject\n            else:\n                sentence += f\", first airing on {triple.object}.\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"series\":\n            if subject is None:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} is a part of the {triple.object} series.\"\n                subject = triple.subject\n            else:\n                sentence += f\", as part of the {triple.object} series.\"\n        elif triple.predicate == \"child\":\n            if subject is None:\n                sentence += f\"{triple.subject} has a child named {triple.object}.\"\n                subject = triple.subject\n            else:\n                sentence += f\", and has a child named {triple.object}.\"\n        else:\n            sentence += f\" The {triple.predicate} is {triple.object}.\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_72\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
