Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: ComicsCharacter. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score. An example of a complex sentence:\nTriples:\n(Antwerp | cityServed | Antwerp International Airport)\n(Belgium | country | Antwerp)\n(City of Brussels | capital | Belgium)\nExample sentence:\n\"Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp which is in Belgium, where the capital is Brussels.\"\n\nThe 'predict' function returns that sentence as a string. Below is the list of all possible predicates that can be given as an input. With the given predicates and example triples implement the 'predict' function so it can process all the possible predicates:\n\nPredicate: alternativeName - Example triple: (Airman (comicsCharacter) | alternativeName | \"Drake Stevens\")\nPredicate: creator - Example triple: (Airman (comicsCharacter) | creator | George Kapitan)\nPredicate: fullName - Example triple: (Auron (comicsCharacter) | fullName | \"Lambien\")\nPredicate: foundedBy - Example triple: (BBC | foundedBy | John Reith, 1st Baron Reith)\nPredicate: keyPerson - Example triple: (BBC | keyPerson | Rona Fairhead)\nPredicate: city - Example triple: (BBC | city | Broadcasting House)\nPredicate: product - Example triple: (BBC | product | BBC Radio)\nPredicate: lastAired - Example triple: (Bananaman | lastAired | \"1986-04-15\")\nPredicate: starring - Example triple: (Bananaman | starring | Graeme Garden)\nPredicate: firstAppearanceInFilm - Example triple: (Baymax | firstAppearanceInFilm | Big Hero 6

birthPlace - Example triple: (Bill Oddie | birthPlace | Rochdale)\nPredicate: nationality - Example triple: (Dick Dillin | nationality | United States)\nPredicate: award - Example triple: (Doug Moench

**Iterative Approach with Combination:** The original code simply appended sentences for each triple. The revised code iterates through the triples and *attempts* to combine the next triple if it shares the same subject. This creates more complex sentences.\n*   **Conditional Combination:** The `if i + 1 < len(triples) and triples[i].subject == triples[i+1].subject:` condition checks if a subsequent triple exists and if it relates to the same subject as the current triple.\n*   **Limited Combination Logic:**  Currently only combines with alternativeName predicates. This could be expanded to include other predicates.\n*   **Incrementing `i`:**  Crucially, the loop counter `i` is incremented correctly to avoid infinite loops and process all triples.\n\nThis modification aims to create more complex and natural-sounding sentences, which should improve the BLUE score by better capturing the relationships between entities in the triples.  The current implementation focuses on combining only alternative names, but can be expanded to other predicates."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"timeout\": true, \"timeout_duration\": 300, \"failure_stage\": \"evaluation\", \"error_type\": \"timeout\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
