changes and reasoning:\n\n*   **Handles Multiple Triples:** The code now iterates through the list of triples instead of just using the first one.\n*   **Predicate-Specific Logic:**  Uses `if/elif` to handle each predicate differently, constructing sentences that are more natural and contextually appropriate for each type of relationship.  This is critical for a good BLUE score.\n*   **Clearer Sentence Structure:** The code builds a sentence incrementally, adding clauses based on the predicate.\n*   **String Formatting:** Uses f-strings for more readable and efficient string construction.\n*   **Handles Empty Input:** Added a check for an empty list of triples to avoid errors.\n*   **strip():** Removes trailing whitespace.\n*   **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain what the function does.\n\nThis revised code will produce more complex and coherent sentences, leading to a significantly improved BLUE score compared to the original, which only generated a very basic sentence based on the first triple.  It provides a foundation for handling the variety of predicates provided in the prompt.  Further improvement could involve handling relationships *between* triples (e.g., combining sentences that share a subject) but this is a solid first step.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_34\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
