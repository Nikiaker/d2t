Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: CelestialBody. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original code duplicated the predicate handling logic within the `if/elif/else` block. This makes the code longer and harder to maintain. More importantly, the redundant `if triple.predicate == ...` checks are unnecessary.  The proposed change simplifies this by directly appending the generic \"has a {predicate} of {object}\" clause for all predicates, removing the duplication and making the code more concise and readable.  The use of \"and\" instead of \", \" will produce more natural sounding sentences when multiple predicates are present for the same subject. This slight change in sentence structure could improve the BLEU score by aligning more closely with the reference sentences.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_11\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
