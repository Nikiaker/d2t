Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: CelestialBody.

This can lead to long, unwieldy sentences.  Adding \"which\" before joining the clauses creates a more natural and readable sentence structure, particularly when multiple properties are described for a single subject. This should improve the fluency and grammatical correctness, leading to a higher BLEU score.
