Your task is to create a Python program that converts a list of triples into natural language text. The given triples will be associated with the topic: CelestialBody. The program should implement a function called 'predict' that accepts a list of triples and generates a coherent, contextually relevant sentence that accurately represents the information contained in the triples. Ensure that the generated text is fluent, grammatically correct, and maintains the meaning of the original data. There can be multiple triples given that make up a complex sentence. Converting all those triples into one sentence will award greater score.

This change aims for consistency by starting most sentences with \"The [property] of [subject] is [object]\" or \"[Subject] has a [property] of [object]\", which should improve coherence and thus the BLEU score. Specifically, the initial code's tendency to use \"The X of Y\" versus \"Y has an X\" creates a subtle inconsistency that can impact the BLEU score. The change promotes a more uniform sentence structure."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_38\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
