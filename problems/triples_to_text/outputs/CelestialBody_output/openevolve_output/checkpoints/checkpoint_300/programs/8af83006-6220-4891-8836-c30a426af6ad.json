This produces very repetitive and unnatural sentences.  The change replaces this with a more comprehensive set of `if/elif` statements that handle each predicate with a more specific and natural phrasing. This will result in sentences that are more grammatically diverse and sound more like human-written text, leading to a higher BLEU score.  It also improves readability and maintainability by explicitly defining how each predicate is handled. This addresses the observed poor performance in the provided examples, where the generated sentences were often very basic and lacked nuance.\nPlease fix it to the correct format.", "responses": ["```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        clauses.append(f\"has a {triple.predicate} of {triple.object}\")\n=======\n        if triple.predicate == \"discoverer\":\n            clauses.append(f\"was discovered by {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"epoch\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has an epoch of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"orbitalPeriod\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has an orbital period of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"apoapsis\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has an apoapsis of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"averageSpeed\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has an average speed of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"escapeVelocity\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has an escape velocity of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"mass\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has a mass of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"temperature\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has a temperature of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"density\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has a density of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"rotationPeriod\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has a rotation period of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"maximumTemperature\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has a maximum temperature of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"meanTemperature\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has a mean temperature of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"minimumTemperature\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has a minimum temperature of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"formerName\":\n            clauses.append(f\"was formerly known as {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"absoluteMagnitude\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has an absolute magnitude of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"discovered\":\n            clauses.append(f\"was discovered on {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"surfaceArea\":\n            clauses.append(f\"has a surface area of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"deathCause\":\n            clauses.append(f\"died of {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"deathPlace\":\n            clauses.append(f\"died in {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"nationality\":\n            clauses.append(f\"is {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"stateOfOrigin\":\n            clauses.append(f\"is from {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"almaMater\":\n            clauses.append(f\"attended {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"birthPlace\":\n            clauses.append(f\"was born in {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"doctoralStudent\":\n            clauses.append(f\"had a doctoral student {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"deathDate\":\n            clauses.append(f\"died on {triple.object}\")\n        elif triple.predicate == \"birthDate\":\n            clauses.append(f\"was born on {triple.object}\")\n        else:\n            clauses.append(f\"has a {triple.predicate} of {triple.object}\")\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"poor_program_score_0\": \"The program did very poorly with BLEU score 0.0.
