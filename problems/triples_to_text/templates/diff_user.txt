# Task
Suggest an improvement to the current program that will improve its scores.
Different solutions with similar fitness but different ideas are valuable.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly, indentations and endlines as well)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of a valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    best_x = 0
    best_y = 0
=======
    # Initialize with a random point
    best_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])
    best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])
>>>>>>> REPLACE

The SEARCH section must exactly match the code in the current program, even with it's indentations and endlines.
Give just one SEARCH/REPLACE section.
