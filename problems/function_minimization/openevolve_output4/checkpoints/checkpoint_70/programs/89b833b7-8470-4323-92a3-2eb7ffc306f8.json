Introduced multiple restarts of the differential evolution algorithm to improve the chances of finding the global minimum.\n2. Combined the results from each restart and selected the best one based on the function value.\n3. Maintained the same inputs and outputs as the original program, but with an improved internal implementation.\n\n**Justification:**\n\nThe original program uses a single run of the differential evolution algorithm, which may not be sufficient to find the global minimum, especially in complex landscapes. By introducing multiple restarts, we can improve the chances of finding the global minimum. This is a common strategy in optimization algorithms, known as \"restarts\" or \"multiple runs.\" The combined results are selected based on the function value, which ensures that the best solution is chosen.\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n\nThe rewritten program should have an improved FITNESS SCORE due to the increased chances of finding the global minimum. The system maintains diversity across the complexity and diversity dimensions, as different solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"stage1_result\": \"Found solution at x=-1.7041, y=0.6775 with value=-1.5187\", \"distance_to_global\": \"0.0005\", \"solution_quality\": \"Distance < 0.5: Very close\", \"convergence_info\": \"Converged in 10 trials with 10 successes\", \"best_position\": \"Final position: x=-1.7041, y=0.6775\", \"average_distance_to_global\": \"0.0005\", \"search_efficiency\": \"Success rate: 100.00%\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
