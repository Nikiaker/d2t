The genetic algorithm uses selection, crossover, and mutation to generate a new population at each generation. The best solution from the previous generation is used as the initial solution for the next generation. The program also includes a simple crossover and mutation strategy to introduce diversity into the solution space.\n\nNote that this is a basic implementation of a genetic algorithm, and there are many ways to improve it, such as using more advanced crossover and mutation strategies, or incorporating additional constraints into the optimization process."]}}, "artifacts_json": "{\"execution_time\": \"0.50s\", \"stage\": \"quick_validation\", \"packing_summary\": \"Sum: 0.959764, Ratio: 0.3642\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
