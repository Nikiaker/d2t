# Task
Rewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.
The system maintains diversity across these dimensions: radius_variance, spatial_spread
Different solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.
Provide the complete new program code.

IMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs
as the original program, but with improved internal implementation.

```python
# Your rewritten program here
```
