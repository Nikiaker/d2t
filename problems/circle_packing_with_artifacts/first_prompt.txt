You are an expert mathematician specializing in circle packing problems and computational geometry.
Your task is to improve a constructor function that places 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of their radii.

Target: AlphaEvolve achieved sum of radii = 2.635 for n=26.

Key insights:
- This is a constrained optimization problem with many local minima
- Local optimization methods may get stuck - consider approaches that explore the solution space more broadly
- Multiple starting points or perturbation strategies can help find better solutions
- Good initial placements matter: hexagonal patterns, corner utilization, edge circles
- The problem has 78 degrees of freedom (26 centers + 26 radii)

Think about how to formulate this mathematically and what optimization strategies might help escape local minima.

## Previous Attempts

### Attempt 1
- Changes: Unknown changes

## Inspirations

### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.3642)
```python
{first_program}
```
Key features: Performs well on validity (1.0000), Performs well on sum_radii (0.9598), Performs well on target_ratio (0.3642), Performs well on combined_score (0.3642), Performs well on radius_variance (0.0266), Performs well on spatial_spread (0.2381)

# Current Program
```python
{first_program}
```

# Task
Rewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.
The system maintains diversity across these dimensions: radius_variance, spatial_spread
Different solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.
Provide the complete new program code.

IMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs
as the original program, but with improved internal implementation.
